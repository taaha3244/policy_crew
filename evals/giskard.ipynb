In the context of the Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) for Affordable Housing Projects, MFI is a critical metric used to determine eligibility for funding and to set affordability standards for housing units. The RFP specifies that at least 90% of project obligations must go to units for households earning no more than 50% of the MFI, and half of those must be for households earning no more than 30% of the MFI. This ensures that the funding prioritizes affordable housing for low-income families, aligning with the goals of the Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) and the broader housing equity objectives outlined in various district plans and reports.\\\\n\\\\nThe relevance of MFI in this context is significant as it directly influences the funding allocation and the types of projects that can be considered for support.

This adjustment helps in maximizing the financial resources available for property improvements.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Modification of Affordability Covenants**: If a property is subject to an existing affordability covenant, applicants can request modifications to the MFI (Median Family Income) mix of the covenant. This can assist in maximizing senior debt, thereby providing more capital for the recapitalization process.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Additional Financing Sources**: It is recommended to seek out additional financing sources, including green financing options like DC PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) and DCSEU (D.C. Sustainable Energy Utility). These sources can provide necessary funds that complement the primary financing for the recapitalization.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Interim Income Contribution**: Property owners are encouraged to contribute interim income or a reasonable percentage of accrued replacement reserves to the rehabilitation efforts.

According to the guidelines, the required affordability period is enforced through a restrictive covenant deed on the property, ensuring that the units remain affordable over the long term.\\\\n\\\\nThe specific duration of the affordability period varies based on the type of project and the total amount of HOPWA assistance received. For instance, projects that involve rehabilitation may have a minimum affordability period ranging from 3 to 10 years, depending on the per-unit subsidy provided. This means that the longer the assistance or the more substantial the funding, the longer the affordability period will be required to ensure that the housing remains accessible to extremely low-income residents.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the affordability period is not a fixed duration but is contingent upon the nature of the project and the financial support it receives, thereby aligning the funding with the goal of maintaining long-term affordability for low-income households.\\\\n\\\\n1.

Document Name: 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects, Page Number: 24\",\"The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) has established comprehensive compliance monitoring procedures for low-income housing projects to ensure adherence to federal and District laws, particularly those related to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program. These procedures are aligned with the requirements set forth in \\\\u00a71.42-5 of the Income Tax Regulations and include several key components.\\\\n\\\\nFirstly, DHCD conducts physical inspections of low-income housing projects to assess compliance with applicable regulations. This is complemented by a review of low-income certifications, which involves examining the documentation that supports these certifications, as well as the rent records for tenants occupying low-income housing units. This thorough review process is designed to ensure that project owners maintain accurate records and comply with the necessary requirements throughout the compliance period.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, project owners are required to maintain specific records for each year of the compliance period, which lasts for 15 years and is extended by at least an additional 25 years through Land Use Restrictive Covenants, totaling a minimum of 40 years. Failure to maintain these records or comply with the guidelines outlined in the DHCD LIHTC Compliance and Monitoring Reference Guide can lead to significant consequences, including the issuance of IRS Form(s) 8823 and potential recapture of tax credits.\\\\n\\\\nMoreover, DHCD has established protocols for notifying project owners of any noncompliance issues. If monitoring reveals noncompliance, DHCD will provide written notice to the project owners, allowing a cure period of up to 90 days to rectify the situation. If the issue is not resolved within this timeframe, it may result in the recapture of LIHTC. For good cause, DHCD may grant an extension of the cure period for up to an additional six months.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, DHCD&#x27;s compliance monitoring procedures are designed to ensure that low-income housing projects adhere to federal regulations throughout the entire compliance period by implementing rigorous monitoring, recordkeeping requirements, and clear protocols for addressing noncompliance.\\\\n\\\\n1.

Doc name: DHCD 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects, Page number: 76\",\"The proposed flow of funds is crucial in the context of recapitalizing existing properties, as it serves to ensure that the financial resources allocated for a project are reasonable and effectively utilized. Specifically, the flow of funds is analyzed by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) to determine the reasonableness of proposed property acquisition costs, which must not exceed the property&#x27;s fair market value as evidenced by an appraisal. This analysis is essential for ensuring that the financial structure of the project supports its sustainability and operational viability.\\\\n\\\\nIn the context of recapitalization, the proposed flow of funds can help identify how existing properties can leverage additional financing sources, including senior debt, to enhance their financial standing. For instance, if an applicant has previously accessed DHCD acquisition financing and the property is under an existing affordability covenant, they may consider modifying the mix of the covenant to maximize senior debt. This strategic adjustment can facilitate the infusion of capital necessary for rehabilitation and improvements, ultimately leading to a more sustainable property.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, the flow of funds is evaluated on a source-by-source basis, ensuring that the terms are consistent with what is commonly available in the market for a particular funding source. This evaluation is critical for applicants who intend to utilize various financing mechanisms, including Income Averaging, as it ensures that all financial strategies align with DHCD&#x27;s guidelines and the overall goals of the project.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the intended purpose of the proposed flow of funds in relation to the recapitalization of existing properties is to ensure that financial resources are allocated effectively, support the sustainability of the project, and facilitate the leveraging of additional financing to enhance property value and operational capacity.\\\\n\\\\n1.

Doc name: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals, Page number: 29\",\"The DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan outlines two specific types of federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs): the 9% Tax Credit and the 4% Tax Credit. \\\\n\\\\n1. **9% Tax Credit**: This credit is competitively awarded to eligible projects based on evaluation criteria set forth in the Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP). It is calculated based on a 10-year present value of 70% of the qualified basis of each building in the project. For non-federally subsidized new buildings placed in service after July 30, 2008, the applicable percentage must be no less than 9%. The maximum LIHTC amount allocated to a project is determined by a formula that considers the amount of eligible costs and the percentage of qualified tenants.\\\\n\\\\n2. **4% Tax Credit**: This credit is available for projects financed with certain tax-exempt bonds. Unlike the 9% Tax Credit, the 4% Tax Credit does not depend on the District\\\\u2019s per capita ceiling. Projects that elect the Average Income minimum set-aside must meet either the 20/50 or 40/60 minimum applicable to tax-exempt bond financing.\\\\n\\\\nRegarding resale conditions for purchasers within the first 15 years, the plan specifies that low-income units in the project must be rent-restricted for a period of at least 40 years, which includes a compliance period of 15 years and an extended use period of at least 25 years. This means that any resale of properties within the first 15 years must adhere to these restrictions to maintain compliance with the LIHTC program requirements.\\\\n\\\\nFor further details, you can refer to the following documents:\\\\n1. **Doc name**: DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan, Page number: 6\\\\n2. **Doc name**: DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan, Page number: 50\\\\n3. **Doc name**: DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan, Page number: 21\",\"The District of Columbia&#x27;s Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) accepts several types of homeownership proposals for the 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP).

The DHCD emphasizes the importance of resident engagement in its evaluation criteria, which includes the demonstration of resident organization strength. This strength is reflected in several key areas:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Quality of Leadership and Communication**: The ability of leaders to inspire cooperation and communicate effectively is essential. A high percentage of participation indicates that residents feel empowered and informed, which aligns with DHCD&#x27;s expectations for transparency and shared authority among leaders (Retrieved Context, page 69).\\\\n\\\\n2. **Fair Elections and Decision-Making**: The guidelines stipulate that elections must be held in a fair and open manner, and that there should be a high level of participation in these processes. This participation is not only a sign of a healthy organizational structure but also demonstrates compliance with DHCD&#x27;s requirements for governance and accountability (Retrieved Context, page 69).\\\\n\\\\n3. **Regular Payment of Dues**: Active participation in meetings and voting on board elections reflects a commitment to the cooperative&#x27;s financial health, which is crucial for meeting funding eligibility requirements. Regular payment of carrying charges by residents indicates a stable financial base, which is necessary for compliance with funding sources (Retrieved Context, page 69).\\\\n\\\\n4. **Consensus Building**: The ability to reach consensus in decision-making processes is vital. High participation rates suggest that residents are engaged in discussions and are more likely to support decisions that align with DHCD&#x27;s guidelines, thereby enhancing the project&#x27;s credibility and compliance with funding criteria (Retrieved Context, page 69).\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the high percentage of resident/member participation not only reflects a strong organizational structure but also demonstrates adherence to DHCD&#x27;s guidelines by ensuring that documentation is consistent and that the cooperative is compliant with the necessary funding sources. This engagement is crucial for the overall success and sustainability of the project proposals submitted to DHCD.\\\\n\\\\n**Document References**: \\\\n1.

Document Name: 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects, Page Number: 64.\",\"The criteria for the 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects are divided into several key categories, which include:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Threshold Eligibility Requirements**: This initial review ensures that all applications conform to the basic eligibility standards set forth in Section VI of the proposal.\\\\n\\\\n2. **Evaluation Criteria**: Once applications pass the Threshold Review, they are evaluated based on specific criteria that align with federal and District laws, as well as the housing priorities and needs of the District. The evaluation criteria are grouped into categories, allowing for a maximum score to be achieved in each sub-category without needing to meet every criterion within that category. Detailed scoring metrics are provided in the Appendix: Evaluation Criteria Subcategory Scoring Matrix in Section XII.\\\\n\\\\n3. **Financial Criteria**: This includes the assessment of the development budget, operating pro-forma, tax credit calculations, and unit information, which are crucial for determining the financial viability of the proposed projects.\\\\n\\\\n4. **Applicant Criteria**: This evaluates the qualifications and capabilities of the applicants themselves, ensuring they have the necessary experience and resources to successfully execute the proposed projects.\\\\n\\\\n5. **Project Readiness and Past Performance**: This criterion assesses how prepared the project is for implementation and the track record of the applicant in managing similar projects.\\\\n\\\\n6. **Inclusive and Equitable Housing**: This focuses on the project&#x27;s commitment to providing housing that is accessible and equitable for all community members.\\\\n\\\\n7. **Place-Based Priorities**: This criterion evaluates how well the project aligns with the specific needs and priorities of the local community.\\\\n\\\\n8. **Maximizing the Impact of DHCD Resources**: This assesses how effectively the project will utilize the resources provided by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD).\\\\n\\\\n9. **Innovative or Community-Oriented Features or Programming**: This looks at any unique aspects of the project that contribute to community engagement or innovative housing solutions.\\\\n\\\\nThese criteria ensure a comprehensive evaluation of each proposal, focusing on both the feasibility of the project and its alignment with community needs and priorities.\\\\n\\\\n**Document References**:\\\\n1.

This includes completing and submitting a series of forms and attachments for each member of the development team, which encompasses corporate documents, qualifications, resumes, references, organizational charts, workload descriptions, AIA documents, statements of real estate owned, and financial statements.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, a completed Phase I Environmental Site Assessment is necessary, which should have been conducted no more than two years prior to the application submission deadline. If the property has existing improvements, the assessment must identify possible asbestos-containing materials and potential mold hazards. If any environmental hazards are identified, a narrative plan for remediation and a budget must be included. \\\\n\\\\nFor projects involving the rehabilitation of existing buildings, a Building Evaluation Report is required, which serves as a preliminary engineering assessment. This report should be completed by a qualified professional to avoid unforeseen issues that could delay or increase costs. Furthermore, a Capital/Physical Needs Assessment or a Property Conditions Needs Assessment will satisfy this requirement.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, a comprehensive market study prepared by an independent professional accredited by the National Council of Housing Market Analysts (NCHMA) is essential. This study must demonstrate sufficient market demand for the proposed project and must have been completed no more than six months prior to the application deadline.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the following are needed for the application:\\\\n1. Guarantor with financial capacity.\\\\n2. Completed forms and attachments for the development team.\\\\n3. Phase I Environmental Site Assessment.\\\\n4.

Doc name: 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects, Page number: 31\",\"To effectively respond to the question of what should be included in a proposal for affordable housing projects, several key components must be addressed. \\\\n\\\\nFirstly, a comprehensive **Resident Services Plan** is essential. This plan should outline the services intended for residents, ensuring they are maintained for at least 15 years. The services may encompass various areas such as training and educational programming focused on academic and economic empowerment, health and wellness initiatives, and resident involvement activities aimed at building organizational capacity. It is crucial that this plan integrates with the project&#x27;s amenities and includes a sales/marketing strategy for homeownership projects, detailing outreach and counseling efforts (2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals, page 48).\\\\n\\\\nSecondly, for projects utilizing dedicated third-party funding sources, it is necessary to include documentation of these sources in the Form 202. This includes letters of interest from multiple lenders and investors, which should reflect current market conditions and substantiate the proposed financing scenarios (2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals, page 24).\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, a **Building Evaluation Report** is required for rehabilitation projects. This report should be conducted by a qualified professional and must include a Capital/Physical Needs Assessment to identify any potential issues that could affect the project (2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals, page 31).\\\\n\\\\nLastly, applicants must provide detailed **financial information** for existing and occupied properties, including current debt structure, operating subsidies, occupancy status, and a current rent roll. Audited financial statements for the previous three fiscal years are also necessary to demonstrate the project&#x27;s financial viability (2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals, page 27).\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the proposal should include a Resident Services Plan, documentation of funding sources, a Building Evaluation Report, and comprehensive financial information to ensure compliance and enhance the project&#x27;s viability.\\\\n\\\\n1.

Specifically, the HPTF contribution to a project cannot exceed 49% of the project&#x27;s total sources. However, there is an exception for Limited Equity Cooperatives (LECs), which must maximize non-HPTF sources but are not subject to this percentage cap.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, for projects that involve Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) equity contributions resulting from a 9% LIHTC request, these contributions are not subject to the 49% limit. However, it is important to note that 9% LIHTC equity will be counted as a DHCD contribution in the leverage calculation for evaluation criteria.\\\\n\\\\nThese guidelines are outlined in the \\\\\"2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects\\\\\" by DHCD, specifically on page 24 and page 38.\\\\n\\\\n1.

They must also disclose any history of substantial liens, defaults, judgments, foreclosures, or bankruptcies, which must be found acceptable to the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD).\\\\n\\\\nAll development team members must sign and submit a Contract Affidavit certifying that they are not debarred from participation in any federal or local program, do not have unresolved default or noncompliance issues with the District of Columbia, and meet the outlined legal/compliance standards. Furthermore, the proposed property management company must not have received an unsatisfactory rating from DHCD or HUD within the past three years.\\\\n\\\\nIn terms of documentation, an extensive series of forms and attachments must be completed and submitted for each member of the development team. This includes corporate documents, qualifications, resumes, references, organizational charts, workload descriptions, AIA documents, statements of real estate owned, and financial statements.\\\\n\\\\nFor projects involving existing buildings, a Building Evaluation Report is required, along with a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment completed no more than two years prior to the application submission. If environmental hazards are identified, a narrative plan for remediation must be included. Additionally, final design schematics and cost estimates must be submitted, reflecting the project&#x27;s scope and intent.\\\\n\\\\nLastly, compliance and monitoring requirements will be enforced throughout the project phases, and applicants must sign a Monitoring Certification Form indicating their agreement to comply with DHCD regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThese requirements are detailed in the \\\\\"2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects\\\\\" document, specifically on pages 28, 29, 31, and 75.\\\\n\\\\n1.
