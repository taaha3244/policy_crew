These documents are essential to demonstrate the payment of LIHTC fees at closing and ensure compliance with the LIHTC program requirements.\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, the DHCD requires a copy of the IRS Form 8609 for each building in the Project, evidence of LIHTC fees paid at closing, and a copy of the Project&#x27;s Federal applicable percentage rate lock agreement to be submitted before the issuance of the IRS Form(s) 8609. This ensures that all necessary documentation related to LIHTC fees and compliance is in place before final approval and allocation of tax credits.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, to provide evidence of LIHTC fees paid at closing, applicants must ensure they have the aforementioned documents ready for submission as part of the closing process. These documents play a crucial role in verifying the payment of LIHTC fees and maintaining compliance with the LIHTC program guidelines.\\\\n\\\\nDocuments used:\\\\n1.

Title: 2023 Consolidated Request for Proposals for Affordable Housing Projects\\\\n   Page Number: 40, 41\",\"The reason project developers need to undergo a subsidy layering review when combining HUD assistance with tax credits is to prevent the Ownership Entity from receiving excessive government subsidies. This review is crucial to ensure that the project remains compliant with financial, development, and compliance criteria set forth by DHCD or DCHFA. By conducting this review, DHCD or DCHFA can assess the project&#x27;s financial feasibility, viability, and its ability to comply with all applicable federal and local regulations.\\\\n\\\\nThe subsidy layering review is a necessary step in the funding application process to determine the maximum LIHTC for which projects are eligible and the minimum required LIHTC needed for feasibility and viability. It involves evaluating the development team&#x27;s capacity, the project&#x27;s financial and economic feasibility, and its ability to adhere to regulations. This review ensures that the project does not receive an excessive amount of government subsidies, which could potentially impact its financial sustainability and compliance with funding requirements.\\\\n\\\\nOverall, the subsidy layering review serves as a safeguard to prevent projects from becoming over-subsidized and helps maintain the integrity of the funding process by ensuring that projects align with the established criteria and guidelines. This process ultimately contributes to the successful development of affordable housing projects that meet the necessary standards for funding approval.\\\\n\\\\nDocuments used:\\\\n1.

This definition is crucial in ensuring project affordability for at least 40 years as it forms the basis for determining the tax credits awarded to qualified recipients under the plan. \\\\n\\\\nMoreover, the Qualified Basis plays a significant role in addressing ownership changes, refinancing, and maintaining affordability. For instance, projects that commit to perpetual affordability or utilize developer-initiated ground leases held by the District emphasize long-term affordability outside of a covenant alone. This approach effectively converts private land to a public asset, ensuring policymakers maintain a decision-making role in the property&#x27;s future use and providing additional protections in case of foreclosure.\\\\n\\\\nBy adhering to the Qualified Basis definition within the DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan, projects can meet the minimum 40-year extended affordability period requirement. This requirement includes waiving the right to seek a qualified contract for project purchase after the 14th year of the Compliance Period, thereby ensuring long-term affordability commitments. Additionally, projects must meet minimum affordable household occupancy restrictions, rent levels, and size limitations to maintain affordability over the designated period.\\\\n\\\\nIn summary, the DHCD 2023 Qualified Allocation Plan&#x27;s definition of &#x27;Qualified Basis&#x27; is integral to ensuring project affordability for at least 40 years, addressing ownership changes, refinancing, and maintaining affordability by providing a clear framework for determining tax credits, committing to long-term affordability strategies, and meeting specific occupancy and rent restrictions. \\\\n\\\\nDocuments used:\\\\n1.
