A higher  LIHTC may be calculated  \nand reserved  where  federal  law permits  and where the  feasibility  analysis  \nindicates  the need  for the additional  LIHTC.  \nAs authorized  by and to the extent  permitted  by IRC \u00a742(d)(5)(B)(v),  enacted  by The Housing  \nand Economic Recovery  Act of 2008,  DHCD, in its sole discretion, may increase  the eligible  \nbasis of  Projects  by up  to 30% (Department \u2019s Basis  Boost)  if it determines that the Project  or a \nbuilding in  the Project needs  the basis  boost  to be financially  feasible.  The Department\u2019s Basis \nBoost is only available to 9% LIHTC Projects.  \nDHCD  has identified  the following  attributes  that could potentially  qualify  a Project  for the \nDepartment \u2019s Basis  Boost:  \n \n\u2022 Projects l ocated in a Planning Area  that is currently below the recommended \nminimum of 15 percent dedicated affordable housing as defined by the \nHousing Framework for Equity and Growth  referenced in this QAP ; or \n\u2022 Projects  located  in a census tract  that meet s the following  demographics  \naccording  to the most  recent Federal Financial Institutions Examination \nCouncil  (FFIEC)  Census  Report  (http:\/\/www.ffiec.gov\/census\/ ):  \no Less than 5% below poverty  level  (see Income)  \no Designated  Middle - or Upper -Income level  (see Demographics); o r \n\u2022 Projects  that achieve  maximum preference in both  of the following  prioritization  \nscoring  categories:  \no mixed -income;  and \no family -oriented  units.  \nProjects  receiving  a 30%  Basis Boost  because of  location  in QCT  or DDA  are not eligible  to \nreceive the Department \u2019s Basis  Boost.  \n4% Tax  Credits  \nIf competitive gap financing is req uired in addition to 4% Tax Credits, the Sponsor\/Developer \nis required to apply for funding as part of the Consolidated RFP  process.  \nBeginning in 2023, if competitive gap financing is not required and a Sponsor\/Developer \nwishes to  exclusively request  tax-exempt bonds and associated 4% Tax Credits , \nSponsors\/Developers  must  first apply  to DHCD for Threshold Review and receive an \nEvaluation Score before  apply ing directly to DCHFA  for tax -exempt bonds.

Project eligibility  requirements  are defined  in the Threshold  Eligibility  Requirements  \nsection  of the QAP.  \nTypes  of Federal  Low Income  Housing  Tax  Credits  \nThere  are two types  of federal LIHTCs:  9% Tax Credits  from the District \u2019s per-capita State  \nCeiling and  4% Tax Credits  issued  to qualifying  Project s financed  with tax-exempt bonds.  \n\u2022 9% Tax Credit:  The 9% Tax Credit  is competitively  awarded  to eligible  \nProject s based on the  evaluation  criteria  in this QAP,  as may be clarified  by \nthe most  recent  Consolidated Request for Proposals  for Affordable Housing  \nProjects (\u201cConsolidated RFP \u201d). The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%. The \nmaximum LIHTC  amount allocated  to a Project  is determined  by a formula  \nthat considers the amount  of eligible  costs  and the percentage  of qualified  \ntenants.   \n\u2022 4% Tax Credit: Projects financed with certain tax -exempt bonds may be \neligible to receive a 4% Tax Credit without regard to the District\u2019 s per capita \nState Ceiling. The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project . For \nProjects  placed in service after December 31, 2020, the applicable \npercentage must be no less than 4%. T ax-exempt bond financed Project s must \nbe evaluated against the Threshold Eligibility Requirements  in this QAP .  \nBoth types of tax credits  must  comply  with two DHCD  monitoring  procedure guideline \ndocuments :  the \u201cDHCD  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and HOME Investment Partnerships \nProgram Owner\u2019s  Compliance Manual\u201d  and the most recent \u201cRFP Compliance and Monitoring \nReference Guide, \u201d which  is incorporated  by reference  in this QAP , and available here: \nhttps:\/\/dhcd.dc.gov\/service\/project -monitoring . \nPer IRC \u00a7 42(e)(3), Projects  must  include either  new construction or substantial  rehabilitation  \nexpenditures totaling  the greater  of $7,900 per unit  for calendar year  2023 (subject to annual  \nincrease)  or 20%  of the adjusted basis  of the building(s).   Projects  that meet the substantial  \nrehabilitation requirements  may also be eligible  for a  tax credit  based  on the acquisition  of the \nbuilding.

This includes rewarding the provision of community stabilizing investments such as \nneighborhood serving retail , grocery stores,  and other desired commercial uses, as well as \nencouraging more diversity of incomes  in housing that has historically further concentrated \npoverty. DHCD will continue to review and adjust priorities and point distribution in the QAP \nand the RFP as needed.  \nResident Services Plans  \nDHCD received several comments in support of adding the written Resident Services Plan as a \nthreshold requirement, adding that it is a best practice seen across other jurisdictions . These \ncommenters, however, also expressed concerns about how resident services should be funded. \nSpecifically, one commenter  strongly opposed any requirement that resident services be paid \nfrom developer fee or outside funding, which may be unpredictable.  The commenter noted that \nif consistent, high -qual ity services are the goal, sponsors should be encouraged to incorporate \nthese costs within the property's operating budget.  \nOne commenter acknowledged that the 2023 QAP responded to their suggestion made in \n2021 to allow applicants to leverage the funding of resident service programs by paying for it \nthrough the developer fee that is capitalized into the LIHTC basis. It was noted, correctly, that \nthe 2023 QAP now states that \u201ca portion of developer fee [can be] reserved for this purpose.\u201d  \nThis commenter als o suggested that DHCD explore alternative approaches to funding resident \nservices. One idea is from Maryland\u2019s QAP which recently added a provision allowing sponsors to request up to an additional 5% above the developer fee limit if the additional fee is d edicated to \nfund a resident services reserve at the time a project comes online. The commenter also suggested an alternative approach: to incentivize capitalization of resident services funds in project \ndevelopment budgets separate from additional developer fees. DHCD will not consider increasing developer fee to fund services since, unlike most other jurisdictions including those that commenters referenced, DHCD has no dollar cap on developer fee (for example, a total fee limit of $4 million or some other limit). Applicants can choose to propose setting aside a portion of developer fee to fund resident services. DHCD will continue to assess this criteria, specifically how resident services are paid for and how that aligns with DHCD developer fee policy.  \nCommenters also sought clarification as to whether outside funding for resident services is \nrequired.  In the 2023 QAP, there are two areas where the Resident Services Plan is \nconsidered. First, as a Threshold Requirement,  each project is required to submit a  written \nResident Services Plan. The Plan should discuss how the resident services will be funded and sustained for at least 15 years. Second, a Project can earn  points in the \nResident Services  sub-\ncategory of the  Evaluation Criteria  for demonstrating that  outside funding is secured for a \nportion of the services budget ( up to 33% , up to 50% , or over 80% of the budget ). DHCD is \nnot requiring a specific type of funding structure, but does suggest that sources could include organizational fundraising, a portio n of developer fee reserved for this purpose, a combination \nof developer fee and fundraising, etc. While  this prioritization was  not changed at this time, \nadditional clarification has been provided for  the minimum Threshold Requirements .  \nOne commenter noted that the cumulative points for the category in the Evaluation Criteria was \neffectively reduced from 25 total points to 15 points (between the nine points for \nResident Services  \nplus six points for Community -Oriented Amenities ). The commenter expressed that these amenities \n\nDocument 145:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 54  of 59  and services are very important for resident experience and should not be de-emphasized. DHCD \nagrees with the  sentiment of this comment, and by making the written Resident Services Plan a \nthreshold requirement, demonstrates this is a n important component of a project and raises the \nbar for all projects that are seeking funding. The Evaluation Criteria  points are now oriented \ntowards giving projects that have a more thorough and thoughtful plan additional points.  \nOne commenter recommended that DHCD broaden the definition of resident services to \ninclude the provision of technical assistance for tenants exercising their TOPA rights and for tenant cooperative boards of directors.  The category includes this area of services, as written; \nadditional clarity has been added to the Threshold Criteria section of the QAP.   \nOne of the commenters encouraged  DHCD to incorporate industry standards for high -quality \nresident services as a prerequisite for scoring in this area. One relatively new  benchmark is the \nCertified Organization for Resident Engagement & Services (CORES) Certification for service \nproviders, which has been incorporated in QAPs in several states.  The CORES Certification  \nrecognizes organizations that have developed a robust co mmitment, capacity, and \ncompetency in providing resident services coordination in affordable rental housing. DHCD will complete  additional research to understand the CORES Certification and will consider adding \nit as a preference or requirement in a future QAP  or RFP .  \nTargeting lowest income households   \nDHCD received numerous comments about the income levels being served and expressed overall support for targeting District resources towards the lowest income households. Many of the comments spoke to the Ho using Production Trust Fund (HPTF) statutory requirements. \nWhile the QAP governs a federal resource, DHCD is committed to coordinating resources, so \nthey are best leveraged to meet the needs of the city\u2019s lowest income households.  \nFor reference, t he Housi ng Production Trust Fund Act of 1988  requires  that each fiscal year:  \n\u2022 At least 50 percent of HPTF funds obligated shall serve extremely low -\nincome households (with incomes at or below 30 percent of Area Median \nIncome (AMI) or Area Median Gross Income (AMGI) ). \n\u2022 At least 40 percent of funds obligated shall  serve very low -income \nhouseholds , with incomes between 30 percent and 50 percent AM GI. \n\u2022 The balance of funds can serve low -income households with incomes up to \n80 percent AM GI. \nDHCD received a comment in support of the flexibility provided by the \nIncome Levels Served \ncategory within the Evaluation Criteria, noting that the weighted average of income levels served may assist preservation projects that are occupied by existing tenants. However, the commente r expressed concern that this section may duplicate preference points awarded under \nthe \nMixed Income  category. The commenter suggested that it would be beneficial to reflect and \nrepeat the importance of adhering to the Housing Production Trust Fund income targeting requirements. DHCD understands this concern but is not making a change at this time.  \nDHCD received one comment suggesting the \nMixed Income  Evaluation Criteria category receive \nfewer points, and another opposing a scoring priority for providing ma rket-rate units.

These standards are meant to ensure that a percentage of units are accessible, or that all building units are adaptable.  \nPoints for Wealth -Building and Other Program  Suggestions  \nDHCD received comments recommending the following changes to the scoring:  \n\u2022 Additional points in the \nHomeownership and Wealth- Building  category for \nProjects providing homeownership opportunities;  \n\u2022 Elimination of the Maximizing Density  point category; \n\u2022 Additional points for Maximizing Impact of DHCD Resources ;  \n\u2022 A standalone scoring opportunity for victims of domestic violence in the \nPrograms to Address Additional Barriers to Housing  category; and  \n\u2022 Reincorporation of partial points in the Resilient Buildings and Innovative \nDesign  category for preservation projects  \nIn regard to the above suggestions, DHCD will continue to assess the impact of the  current  \nchanges to the Evaluation Criteria in this and future application rounds, but has not made further updates to the Evaluation Criteria at this time.  \nOne commenter suggested adding a new evaluation criteria with a preference for small buildings of 50 units  or less. DHCD does not intend to add a preference for small buildings at this time.  \nNon -Profit Participation and Right of First Refusal  \nSeveral commenters wrote to suggest specific changes to the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) requirements: one suggested that the ROFR be effective after the end of the credit period; \nanother that the purchase price calculated by the project accountants be deemed final other \nthan due to manifest error. The requirements in the QAP related to a ROFR are considered the \nminimum requirements; terms that may be more favorable to the holder of the ROFR are \nsubject to negotiation between the developer and its investor.  \nDHCD will monitor investor exit and Year 15 issues as they arise. Several industry partners are monitoring current litigation and other Year 15 issues across the country, and may be the best \nresource for non- profit organizations in their partnership searches and negotiations.  \nOne commenter suggested that this category be re -named to better reflect the focus on the \nright of first refusal, and that points match the 2021 QAP  (a two -point reduction from the \n2023 QAP) . DHCD will monitor the impact of this change to the scoring criteria, and will make \nany necessary adjustments in future QAPs\/RFPs . \nAffordability  Period Restriction  \nOne commente r suggested  that a perpetual affordability restriction \u2013  defined as a term of 99 \nyears \u2013 be a Threshold requirement for all projects awarded LIHTC, or that the points awarded \nfor projects selecting perpetual affordability be increased .  \n\nDocument 146:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 55 of 59  income housing has long been recognized as a best practice in the affordable housing  field, either \nfor projects that are 100% affordable but provide a range of units for different household \nincomes, or for those that incorporate both affordable and unrestricted market- rate units in the \nsame building. DHCD strongly supports communities that offer housing for a range of household incomes, and must make resources available to household s with a wide variety of income levels.   \nTwo commenters shared that it is more important to select projects that best respond to critical needs, particularly those that advance the HPTF statutory income targets, instead of focusing on requirements for developer qualifications. DH CD\u2019s development team criteria help \nto ensure that projects have a high likelihood of being completed and are brought through pre -\ndevelopment, construction completion, and into sustainable long -term operations as proposed. \nThe new \nDeveloper Capacity Buildi ng sub-category to the Evaluation Criteria prioritizes \nprojects with developers with limited experience.  \nHousing for Older Adults  \nDHCD received comments in favor of separating Housing for Older Adults and Accessible \nHousing into two categories, and speci fying applicants to follow the Virginia Universal Design \nStandard. DHCD also received two comments suggesting that the Housing for Older Adults point category not require applying accessibility standards to all housing units in the development.  The 2021 Q AP did award points for projects that included units designed and \nreserved for seniors and\/or people with disabilities, with maximum preference awarded to Projects for seniors (55+) in which all units met either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. The 2023 QAP, however, acknowledges the differentiated needs of seniors and \nother special -needs groups by allocating points to both Housing for Older Adults and \nAcce ssible Housing. Applicants may receive points for the Housing for Older Adults category if \ntheir proposed mix fully complies with the Fair Housing Act and Housing for Older Persons Act \nof 1995 (HOPA) Exemption.  DHCD disagrees with the assertion that requir ing certain  \naccessibility stan dards for housing for older adults  is an unreasonable requirement to obtain \npoints.  DHCD is of the opinion that requiring units for older adults to have a minimal standard \nsuch as ANSI Type A units allows residents to age in p lace and prolong their ability to stay in \ntheir community.  \nOne commenter asked for clarity on the point allocation for age restricted housing for people \n62+ or age restricted housing for people 55+. Points will be awarded to applicants regardless of which of the three HOPA Exemptions they qualify for: (1) developments specifically designed \nand operated to assist elderly persons; (2) developments intended for, and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older; and (3) developments intended and operated  for occupancy \nby persons 55 years of age or older. One additional point is awarded to Projects that target \nthe 62+ age range.  \nAccessible Housing  \nDHCD received a comment recommending against requiring projects to meet ANSI Type A \nstandards for all housing units. The 2023 QAP awards points for Projects where all units meet \nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility standard s. ANSI Type A \nis an adaptable unit, unlike UFAS or ANSI Accessible units, which do not have grab bars and \nother features installed at construction .

Further, m any projects selected in the past several QAP and RFP rounds have \ncommitted to perpetual affordability , and have received prioritization points for this \ncommitment. In this regard, DHCD is  largely  in line with its peer allocating agencies, many of \nwhom distinguish affordability requirements and priori tization between credit types, and \nwhether or not projects receive  public gap financing in addition to LIHTC allocations.  \nIn this update to the QAP, DHCD will award maximum available points in the Affordability \nPeriod Restriction  sub-category to projects that utilize a  developer -initiated  ground lease  held \nby the District,  emphasizing  another viable tool for ensuring long -term affordability  outside of \na covenant alone.  Effectively converting private land to a public asset, as the commenter \ndescribes, ensur es that policymakers maintain  a decision -making role in the future use of the \nproperty  \u2013 and, further, will provide additional protections tha n standalone covenants, such as \naffordability restrictions  that survive  in the case of a foreclosure.  \nThe threshold affordability requirement and points allocation for long -term affordability \ncommitments ha ve otherwise  not been changed at this time. DHCD will continue to assess \nthese tools and incentives for future QAPs and RFPs .  \nCosts and Expenses  \nDHCD re ceived a comment recommending Design Guideline criteria in lieu of or in conjunction \nwith construction cost guidelines. Construction cost guidelines calculated on a per -square foot \nbasis provide a simple, across -the-board standard which still allows  for va riability based on \nmarket conditions and individual teams\u2019 design preferences. It should also be noted that some \ndesign elements are accounted for in the Enterprise Green Communities standards, DC\u2019s \nBuilding Energy Performance Standards, and other concurrent compliance processes. DHCD will continue exploring the best ways to evaluate construction costs and will further assess whether it may be appropriate to implement additional design standards. No related change to the QAP has been made at this time.  \nDHCD  received a comment recommending a Real Estate tax abatement for for -profit entities. \nThis policy recommendation would require citywide legislation through the DC Council budgeting process. No change has been made to the QAP at this time.  \nDHCD received a c omment requesting that the LIHTC Compliance Monitoring Fee be \nexcluded from operating expenses. As an annual fee, it is eligible as an operating expense. No \nchange has been made to the fee schedule at this time.  \nDHCD received a comment suggesting that not all HPTF projects be required to comply with \nDavis Bacon labor and wage standards. This is a Federal statutory requirement through the Davis -Bacon Act, as Amended, that did not originate with the Qualified Allocation Plan; Title 40, \nSec. 3142 of the law sp ecifically states that either Federal or District of Columbia contracts in \nexcess of $2,000 will utilize the labor and wage standards. The agency is aware of the impact Davis Bacon requirements have on construction costs and accounts for that premium during underwriting review. No change has been made to this requirement at this time.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":147,"topic":"Others"}}

This includes rewarding the provision of community stabilizing investments such as \nneighborhood serving retail , grocery stores,  and other desired commercial uses, as well as \nencouraging more diversity of incomes  in housing that has historically further concentrated \npoverty. DHCD will continue to review and adjust priorities and point distribution in the QAP \nand the RFP as needed.  \nResident Services Plans  \nDHCD received several comments in support of adding the written Resident Services Plan as a \nthreshold requirement, adding that it is a best practice seen across other jurisdictions . These \ncommenters, however, also expressed concerns about how resident services should be funded. \nSpecifically, one commenter  strongly opposed any requirement that resident services be paid \nfrom developer fee or outside funding, which may be unpredictable.  The commenter noted that \nif consistent, high -qual ity services are the goal, sponsors should be encouraged to incorporate \nthese costs within the property's operating budget.  \nOne commenter acknowledged that the 2023 QAP responded to their suggestion made in \n2021 to allow applicants to leverage the funding of resident service programs by paying for it \nthrough the developer fee that is capitalized into the LIHTC basis. It was noted, correctly, that \nthe 2023 QAP now states that \u201ca portion of developer fee [can be] reserved for this purpose.\u201d  \nThis commenter als o suggested that DHCD explore alternative approaches to funding resident \nservices. One idea is from Maryland\u2019s QAP which recently added a provision allowing sponsors to request up to an additional 5% above the developer fee limit if the additional fee is d edicated to \nfund a resident services reserve at the time a project comes online. The commenter also suggested an alternative approach: to incentivize capitalization of resident services funds in project \ndevelopment budgets separate from additional developer fees. DHCD will not consider increasing developer fee to fund services since, unlike most other jurisdictions including those that commenters referenced, DHCD has no dollar cap on developer fee (for example, a total fee limit of $4 million or some other limit). Applicants can choose to propose setting aside a portion of developer fee to fund resident services. DHCD will continue to assess this criteria, specifically how resident services are paid for and how that aligns with DHCD developer fee policy.  \nCommenters also sought clarification as to whether outside funding for resident services is \nrequired.  In the 2023 QAP, there are two areas where the Resident Services Plan is \nconsidered. First, as a Threshold Requirement,  each project is required to submit a  written \nResident Services Plan. The Plan should discuss how the resident services will be funded and sustained for at least 15 years. Second, a Project can earn  points in the \nResident Services  sub-\ncategory of the  Evaluation Criteria  for demonstrating that  outside funding is secured for a \nportion of the services budget ( up to 33% , up to 50% , or over 80% of the budget ). DHCD is \nnot requiring a specific type of funding structure, but does suggest that sources could include organizational fundraising, a portio n of developer fee reserved for this purpose, a combination \nof developer fee and fundraising, etc. While  this prioritization was  not changed at this time, \nadditional clarification has been provided for  the minimum Threshold Requirements .  \nOne commenter noted that the cumulative points for the category in the Evaluation Criteria was \neffectively reduced from 25 total points to 15 points (between the nine points for \nResident Services  \nplus six points for Community -Oriented Amenities ). The commenter expressed that these amenities \n\nDocument 34:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 35 Form 202 Consolidated RFP as a Permanent Source, as Non -Residential Income, \nand\/or as additional cash flow in the 20 -year proforma that enable a larger deferred \ndeveloper fee. The Inflation Reduction Act allows Projects to claim both the Solar \nInvestment Tax Credit ( Solar ITC), LIHTC, DC LIHTC, and other related tax credits on \nthe solar expenses incurred by the Project. DHCD expects that the funding benefits of the solar, including but not limited to the Solar ITC and Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (SRECs ), will be included as a source for the Project.  Projects utilizing a \nPower Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) or other indirect development arrangement for \nsolar  will need to request a waiver.\n  \n \n16. Relocation and Anti -Displacement Strategy  \nFor existing and occupied buildings\/properties that result in the temporary or \npermanent displacement of current occupants, including commercial tenants, the applicant must submit a Relocation and Anti -Displacement Strategy. This strategy \n(due with the application) provides the groundwork for the Relocation and Anti -\nDisplacement Plan (due before the issuance of a Letter of Commitment for financing). All projects financed through this RFP will be held to the standards of the Uniform Relocation Act and the District\u2019s Rental Housing Act.  \n \nInstances where a strategy and plan are required include the following, regardless of funding source:  \n\u2022 Tenants will be required to move to facilitate the building\u2019s rehabilitation, even \nif they are moved to other units within the same building or complex;  \n\u2022 Demolition of existing dwelling or  commercial  units or buildings that are \noccupied at the time of acquisition or at the time the applicant executes a legal instrument that demonstrates site control; or  \n\u2022 Tenants will be displaced because the proposed rents are not affordable to \nthose households . \n \n17. Resident Services  Plan  \nA submission of a Resident Services Plan is a new threshold requirement for 2023. All applicants must submit a written plan summarizing how they intend to provide high-quality, property -wide resident services designed to empower residents, improve \nresidents\u2019 quality of life, and support broader community -building goals. The plan \nshould describe how the proposed resident services are targeted to the resident population an d support anticipated community needs and interests.   As applicable \nand further described in the Evaluation Criteria section, resident services may also include the provision of technical assistance for tenants exercising their TOPA rights and for residen t cooperative  or condominium  boards of directors  as well as  upfront \nand ongoing support and stewardship services for  First-Time Homebuyers .  \n Community amenities should also be indicated in the resident services and architectural plans and should be consistent with the services proposed for the site. At a minimum, the plan should highlight at least one service and one amenity being \nproposed for the resident community, including but not limited to those described in ","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"simple","seed_document_id":35,"topic":"Others"}}

DHCD strongly supports communities that offer housing for a range of household incomes, and must make resources available to household s with a wide variety of income levels.   \nTwo commenters shared that it is more important to select projects that best respond to critical needs, particularly those that advance the HPTF statutory income targets, instead of focusing on requirements for developer qualifications. DH CD\u2019s development team criteria help \nto ensure that projects have a high likelihood of being completed and are brought through pre -\ndevelopment, construction completion, and into sustainable long -term operations as proposed. \nThe new \nDeveloper Capacity Buildi ng sub-category to the Evaluation Criteria prioritizes \nprojects with developers with limited experience.  \nHousing for Older Adults  \nDHCD received comments in favor of separating Housing for Older Adults and Accessible \nHousing into two categories, and speci fying applicants to follow the Virginia Universal Design \nStandard. DHCD also received two comments suggesting that the Housing for Older Adults point category not require applying accessibility standards to all housing units in the development.  The 2021 Q AP did award points for projects that included units designed and \nreserved for seniors and\/or people with disabilities, with maximum preference awarded to Projects for seniors (55+) in which all units met either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. The 2023 QAP, however, acknowledges the differentiated needs of seniors and \nother special -needs groups by allocating points to both Housing for Older Adults and \nAcce ssible Housing. Applicants may receive points for the Housing for Older Adults category if \ntheir proposed mix fully complies with the Fair Housing Act and Housing for Older Persons Act \nof 1995 (HOPA) Exemption.  DHCD disagrees with the assertion that requir ing certain  \naccessibility stan dards for housing for older adults  is an unreasonable requirement to obtain \npoints.  DHCD is of the opinion that requiring units for older adults to have a minimal standard \nsuch as ANSI Type A units allows residents to age in p lace and prolong their ability to stay in \ntheir community.  \nOne commenter asked for clarity on the point allocation for age restricted housing for people \n62+ or age restricted housing for people 55+. Points will be awarded to applicants regardless of which of the three HOPA Exemptions they qualify for: (1) developments specifically designed \nand operated to assist elderly persons; (2) developments intended for, and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older; and (3) developments intended and operated  for occupancy \nby persons 55 years of age or older. One additional point is awarded to Projects that target \nthe 62+ age range.  \nAccessible Housing  \nDHCD received a comment recommending against requiring projects to meet ANSI Type A \nstandards for all housing units. The 2023 QAP awards points for Projects where all units meet \nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility standard s. ANSI Type A \nis an adaptable unit, unlike UFAS or ANSI Accessible units, which do not have grab bars and \nother features installed at construction . These standards are  to ensure buildings and facilities \n\nDocument 41:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 42 To qualify for this category, projects must provide a marketing and resident selection plan \nthat addresses leasing to the underserved population(s) and a detailed supportive services \nplan that explains  the programming and how it will be funded long -term .  \n \nHousing for Older Adult s (Up to +5)  \nPoints  will be awarded for Projects that include units designed and reserved for seniors \n(55+ or 62 +), including assisted living  and independent living  units . Maximum  points will be \nawarded  to Projects that provide assisted living units . Points  will be awarded, in \ndescending order, for independent living  age restricted  housing  for people aged 62+, and \nage restricted housing  for people aged 55+ , including grandfamily units.  \n   \nIf the proposed project includes  assisted living, independent living, or age restricted  \nhousing, all units must be accessible utilizing either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. Type A units are adaptable units that can allow seniors and people with mobility \nissues to age in place. Type A units must meet the requirements as defined in Chapter 11 of the 2013 District of Columbia Building Code .  \n Applicants receiving these points must affirmatively demonstrate that their proposed mix is fully compliant with the Fair Housing Act and the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 \n(HOPA) Exemption.  \n \nAccessible Housing ( Up to +5)  \nMaximum points will be awarded to Projects that meet The Kelsey design standards\n at \neither the Silver\/Gold\/Platinum level and\/or utilize Universal Design as defined in the \nVirginia Universal Design Standard .

This includes fee \nsimple ownership, condominiums, Limited Equity Cooperatives, and shared equity models such as community land trust -supported Projects . Points will be awarded for Projects  that are  \nstructured to transfer to tenant ownership after the initial  15-year  compliance period , through \nthe Right of First Refusal provided for in Section 42(i)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code . Partial \npoints will be awarded for Projects that provide wealth -building services that may better \nprepare tenants to be homeowners, including but not limited to positive rent reporting for credit scores, rent payment incentives, connecting unbanked or underbanked residents to financial institutions, or shared appreciation.  \n\nDocument 147:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 56  of 59  are designed and constructed to accommodate individuals with mobility impairments, \nparticularly those who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or scooters. Nonetheless, Projects may also receive points if they provide twice the number of accessible and audio\/visual units as required by Section 504, allowing d evelopers greater flexibility depending on their \ndevelopment model and target populations. These standards are meant to ensure that a percentage of units are accessible, or that all building units are adaptable.  \nPoints for Wealth -Building and Other Program  Suggestions  \nDHCD received comments recommending the following changes to the scoring:  \n\u2022 Additional points in the \nHomeownership and Wealth- Building  category for \nProjects providing homeownership opportunities;  \n\u2022 Elimination of the Maximizing Density  point category; \n\u2022 Additional points for Maximizing Impact of DHCD Resources ;  \n\u2022 A standalone scoring opportunity for victims of domestic violence in the \nPrograms to Address Additional Barriers to Housing  category; and  \n\u2022 Reincorporation of partial points in the Resilient Buildings and Innovative \nDesign  category for preservation projects  \nIn regard to the above suggestions, DHCD will continue to assess the impact of the  current  \nchanges to the Evaluation Criteria in this and future application rounds, but has not made further updates to the Evaluation Criteria at this time.  \nOne commenter suggested adding a new evaluation criteria with a preference for small buildings of 50 units  or less. DHCD does not intend to add a preference for small buildings at this time.  \nNon -Profit Participation and Right of First Refusal  \nSeveral commenters wrote to suggest specific changes to the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) requirements: one suggested that the ROFR be effective after the end of the credit period; \nanother that the purchase price calculated by the project accountants be deemed final other \nthan due to manifest error. The requirements in the QAP related to a ROFR are considered the \nminimum requirements; terms that may be more favorable to the holder of the ROFR are \nsubject to negotiation between the developer and its investor.  \nDHCD will monitor investor exit and Year 15 issues as they arise. Several industry partners are monitoring current litigation and other Year 15 issues across the country, and may be the best \nresource for non- profit organizations in their partnership searches and negotiations.  \nOne commenter suggested that this category be re -named to better reflect the focus on the \nright of first refusal, and that points match the 2021 QAP  (a two -point reduction from the \n2023 QAP) . DHCD will monitor the impact of this change to the scoring criteria, and will make \nany necessary adjustments in future QAPs\/RFPs . \nAffordability  Period Restriction  \nOne commente r suggested  that a perpetual affordability restriction \u2013  defined as a term of 99 \nyears \u2013 be a Threshold requirement for all projects awarded LIHTC, or that the points awarded \nfor projects selecting perpetual affordability be increased .  \n\nDocument 125:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 34  of 59  The scoring  for PSH units  is guided by Chapter  4 of the Interagency Council on \nHomelessness\u2019 (ICH)  2021-2025  strategic  plan, titled Homeward DC 2.0, available at : \nhttps:\/\/ich.dc.gov\/page\/homeward -dc-20-ich-strategic -plan -fy2021 -fy2025  \nFamily -Oriented  Units   \nMaximum points  will be awarded to Projects  in which  at least 30%  of the affordable  units \nhave  three  or more  bedrooms.

Project eligibility  requirements  are defined  in the Threshold  Eligibility  Requirements  \nsection  of the QAP.  \nTypes  of Federal  Low Income  Housing  Tax  Credits  \nThere  are two types  of federal LIHTCs:  9% Tax Credits  from the District \u2019s per-capita State  \nCeiling and  4% Tax Credits  issued  to qualifying  Project s financed  with tax-exempt bonds.  \n\u2022 9% Tax Credit:  The 9% Tax Credit  is competitively  awarded  to eligible  \nProject s based on the  evaluation  criteria  in this QAP,  as may be clarified  by \nthe most  recent  Consolidated Request for Proposals  for Affordable Housing  \nProjects (\u201cConsolidated RFP \u201d). The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%.

The right of first refusal may be exercised anytime \nwithin a twenty -four (24) m onth period, or longer period, after the close of the Compliance \nPeriod. Once exercised, the Q ualified N on-profit O rganization shall have at least  twelve (12) \nmonths to close on the purchase of the Project  or the interests of the non -managing members of \nthe Ownership Entity. The Q ualified N on-profit Organization may assign the right of first refusal \nto a governmental entity, another Qualified N on-profit  Organization , or a tenant organization. In \nall instanc es where the non- managing members of the Ownership Entity have the right to \nconsent to the exercise or assignment of the right of first refusal, such consent shall not be \nunreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The non- managing members of the Owners hip \nEntity may not withhold consent for a non -material breach of the Ownership Entity \norganizational documents. The purchase price shall be calculated by the Project  accountants \nand shall be based on the minimum purchase price in IRC \u00a7 42(i)(7)(B) plus the amount needed to \npay any unpaid fees, loans or other amounts due to the non- managing members of the \nOwnership Entity from the managing member  or general partner, as applicable . \nThe right of first refusal can not be  conditioned upon receipt by the Owner of a  bona fide offer \nfrom any party, including a third party. The right of first refusal  as outlined in IRC \u00a7 42(i)(7), as \nmay be amended from time to time,  is not the same as a r ight of first refusal  under statutory, \ncourt -interpreted, or common law.  \nAll rights of first refusal granted to Q ualified N on-profit O rganizations are subject to the \nrequirements of the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA) and the District\u2019s Opportunity to Purchase Amendm ent Act of 2008, DC Law 17- 286 (DC Official Code \u00a7 42-3404.31 \net seq. ), \nas either may be amended from time to time.  \nPermanent  Supportive Housing  (PSH)  \nFor new construction rental  Project s\u2014and rental  Project s that rehabilitate  existing,  vacant  \nbuilding s\u2014at least  5% of the units,  and no less than one unit,  must  be designated as  PSH as \ndefined  in this QAP.

DHCD  will determine  if the benefits  to the \nDistrict  are sufficient to warrant  the issuance  of a Forward  Reservation.  In \nmost  cases this determination  will rely primarily on the following  factors:  \n \n1. whether  the Sponsor \u2019s\/Developer \u2019s LIHTC  request is large  enough  to \nrequire being split because an award in a single year would eliminate the \navailability  of LIHTC to other  competitive  applicants; and \n2. if the scope of the rehabilitation or construction is such that it is unlikely that the entire Project  can be \u201cplaced in se rvice\u201d within the time frame required \nby the IRC.  \nProjects  Unable  to Meet  Deadlines  \nSome  Project (s) that have  received  Reservations are not  able  to meet  the schedule outlined in  \nthe Reservation  for reasons beyond  the control of the Developer but  are Project s the DHCD  \nDirector may deem  to be essential  to DHCD \u2019s strategic  plan  or mission.

Failure  to meet these  requirements  will result  in the loss of \nthe LIHTC for  the Project.  \nTo demonstrate that a Project meets the 10% Test, DHCD requires the owner to submit:  \n1. an owner\u2019s  certification,  which  includes  an itemized  list of Project  \nexpenditures ; and \n2. a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) \u2019s opinion documenting that the Project  \nhas met the 10% Test  within 12 months of the date of the allocation of tax \ncredits.  \nReservation  Letters  will identify  a date certain by which  Sponsor s\/Developer s must certify  \nthat:  (1) Project s have  been  placed  in service; or (2) at  a minimum, that more  than  10 percent o f \nthe reasonably anticipated  basis of the  Project  has been  incurred.  If the Sponsor\/Developer  \nhas not met either  of these  requirements,  the Reservation  may be cancelled.  Any LIHTC  \navailable  from  cancelled  Reservations  will be awarded  to other  Project s or carried  forward  in \nthe District \u2019s unallocated  pool.

Further, m any projects selected in the past several QAP and RFP rounds have \ncommitted to perpetual affordability , and have received prioritization points for this \ncommitment. In this regard, DHCD is  largely  in line with its peer allocating agencies, many of \nwhom distinguish affordability requirements and priori tization between credit types, and \nwhether or not projects receive  public gap financing in addition to LIHTC allocations.  \nIn this update to the QAP, DHCD will award maximum available points in the Affordability \nPeriod Restriction  sub-category to projects that utilize a  developer -initiated  ground lease  held \nby the District,  emphasizing  another viable tool for ensuring long -term affordability  outside of \na covenant alone.  Effectively converting private land to a public asset, as the commenter \ndescribes, ensur es that policymakers maintain  a decision -making role in the future use of the \nproperty  \u2013 and, further, will provide additional protections tha n standalone covenants, such as \naffordability restrictions  that survive  in the case of a foreclosure.  \nThe threshold affordability requirement and points allocation for long -term affordability \ncommitments ha ve otherwise  not been changed at this time. DHCD will continue to assess \nthese tools and incentives for future QAPs and RFPs .  \nCosts and Expenses  \nDHCD re ceived a comment recommending Design Guideline criteria in lieu of or in conjunction \nwith construction cost guidelines. Construction cost guidelines calculated on a per -square foot \nbasis provide a simple, across -the-board standard which still allows  for va riability based on \nmarket conditions and individual teams\u2019 design preferences. It should also be noted that some \ndesign elements are accounted for in the Enterprise Green Communities standards, DC\u2019s \nBuilding Energy Performance Standards, and other concurrent compliance processes. DHCD will continue exploring the best ways to evaluate construction costs and will further assess whether it may be appropriate to implement additional design standards. No related change to the QAP has been made at this time.  \nDHCD  received a comment recommending a Real Estate tax abatement for for -profit entities. \nThis policy recommendation would require citywide legislation through the DC Council budgeting process. No change has been made to the QAP at this time.  \nDHCD received a c omment requesting that the LIHTC Compliance Monitoring Fee be \nexcluded from operating expenses. As an annual fee, it is eligible as an operating expense. No \nchange has been made to the fee schedule at this time.  \nDHCD received a comment suggesting that not all HPTF projects be required to comply with \nDavis Bacon labor and wage standards. This is a Federal statutory requirement through the Davis -Bacon Act, as Amended, that did not originate with the Qualified Allocation Plan; Title 40, \nSec. 3142 of the law sp ecifically states that either Federal or District of Columbia contracts in \nexcess of $2,000 will utilize the labor and wage standards. The agency is aware of the impact Davis Bacon requirements have on construction costs and accounts for that premium during underwriting review. No change has been made to this requirement at this time.\n\nDocument 124:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 33  of 59   \nError- Free Submission  \nProposals with inconsistent information between the Project narrative, application, and back -up \ndocumentation including the Form 202 will be negatively impacted and have points deducted. \nProjects with assumptions outside of the DHCD guidelines as stated in the Consolidated RFP , \nUnderwriting Guide , or other published guidance will also be negatively impacted. Projects that \nhave proposed uses that are associated with dedicated third -party funding sources must include \nthose sources in the Form 202. For example , all viable green financing\/funding sources must be \nincluded, including benefits provided in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).  \nReadiness to Proceed  \nProjects applying for gap financing with a closing timeline greater than 12 months from being \nselected for further underwriting by DHCD, based on application timeline, narrative, and \nsupporting documentation, will be negatively impacted and have points deducted.  Projects \napplying for 4% LIHTC in conjunction with a tax -exempt bond allocation must be able to close \non all Project financing within six months of the submission of an application to DCHFA.  \nCompliance with DHCD Cost and Funding Guidelines  \nProjects that do not follow DHCD\u2019s Underwriting Guidelines will be negatively impacted.  Underwriting \nGuidelines include construction cost, soft cost, and operating cost guidelines that are updated \nperiodically and will be specified in the  Consolidated RFP, online application , or Underwriting Guide. \nThe purpose of these requirements is to ensure efficient us e of DHCD funds and thus enable DHCD \nto serve more households with its finite amount of subsidy funds. A number of these guidelines are \nfirm requirements and cannot be waived. In other instances, Projects may be outside a certain \nguideline, but their appli cation will be negatively impacted. Points will be deduc ted per each 5% \nincrement over max construction cost or operating cost guideline, or soft cost guideline.  \nPast Performance  \nThe past performance of existing Project s in the development team\u2019s portfolio will be critically \nevaluated with consideration for any legal\/noncompliance matters. A pplications for which \nmembers of the development team, as applicable, participated in prior Project s that were \ndelayed, had a U.S. D epartment of Labor (DOL) wage rate complaint and subsequent \ninvestigation, and\/or did not submit annual reporting to DHCD\u2019s Portfolio and Asset \nManagement Division (PAMD)  will be negatively impacted  and have points deducted.   \n \nPermanent  Supportive Housing  \nAside from t he 5% PSH T hreshold Eligibility Requirement for all Production  Project s, Project s \nalso may earn points by creating additional PSH units beyond the minimum number required. \nThese points are available to both production and preservation Project s. Maximum points will \nbe awarded to Project s that set aside at least 20% of the units as PSH units.

Complete Form 215  with detailed estimates of costs based on \u201ctake- offs\u201d from \nthose plans, completed and signed by an architect,  general contractor , engineer,  \nor professional construction cost estimator.  \u201cRule of thumb ,\u201d square foot costs or \nother non- detailed cost estimates are not acceptable, and a Form 215 completed \nand signed by the developer will not be accepted . \n Construction cost estimates must be consistent across all parts of the application, \nincluding the Form 202, the Form 215, and the Online Application System. Cost \nestimates must adhere to DHCD\u2019s construction cost guidelines identified herein or follow the waiver request requirements if the costs exceed the allowable limits.  \n\nDocument 26:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 27 DHCD reserves the right to request a second appraisal. An appraisal update will be \nrequired before closing so that a current appraised value is available within 120 days \nof closing. If federal funding is proposed, the acquisition cost (regardless of how it is \nfunded) may not exceed the market value per a new or updated appraisal made within 120 days of closing on DHCD financing.  \n For Projects w here the property has already been acquired, acquisition cost \nreasonableness will be based on the original purchase price plus reasonable carrying \nand settlement costs. Applicants must submit the following for DHCD to determine reasonableness: the deed, the appraisal at the time of acquisition, the HUD -1 \nsettlement sheet at the time of acquisition to demonstrate the purchase price and associated settlement charges, and detailed assumptions behind carrying charges \nincluded in the budget since acquisition.  \n \nIf the property was previously purchased by a n Affiliate of the \nDeveloper\/Owner\/Sponsor, has increased in value, and the project budget reflects the current appraised value of the property, DHCD expects a reasonable proportion \nof the net proceeds from the increased property value to be offset by a seller\u2019s note \nor other similar instrument. DHCD defines a reasonable proportion as the  increase in  \nvalue of the property  since the initial acquisition that exceeds  a maximum rate of \nreturn  of 13% to the owner. The 13% amount is consistent with  twenty -year historic \nreturns for apartment R eal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) according to data from \nthe National Association of R eal Estate Investment Trusts  \n(https:\/\/www.reit.com\/data -research\/reit -indexes\/annual -index -values -returns\n). If the \nproperty was acquired as a result of tenants exercising their TOPA rights, the final purc hase and sale agreement with the seller must be provided.  \n \nIf the property includes existing improvements that will be demolished as part of the \ndevelopment plan, the appraisal takes the cost of demolition into consideration for an \u201cas vacant\u201d land value.  \n \nProjects that received or will receive discounted land or property through a District \nland or property disposition (LDA or PDA) must reflect the value of the write- down in \ntheir budget. The budgeted acquisition price for these projects must either be zero , \nminimal , or if the budget reflects the full appraised value of the property, offset by a \nseller\u2019s note or other similar instrument.  \n \nIf applicable, LIHTC projects must use their best effort to include the acquisition c osts \nin eligible  basis, consi stent with Section 42 (d)(2 )(B), Section 42 (d)(2)(D), and Section \n42(d)(6)  of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n7.

DHCD strongly supports communities that offer housing for a range of household incomes, and must make resources available to household s with a wide variety of income levels.   \nTwo commenters shared that it is more important to select projects that best respond to critical needs, particularly those that advance the HPTF statutory income targets, instead of focusing on requirements for developer qualifications. DH CD\u2019s development team criteria help \nto ensure that projects have a high likelihood of being completed and are brought through pre -\ndevelopment, construction completion, and into sustainable long -term operations as proposed. \nThe new \nDeveloper Capacity Buildi ng sub-category to the Evaluation Criteria prioritizes \nprojects with developers with limited experience.  \nHousing for Older Adults  \nDHCD received comments in favor of separating Housing for Older Adults and Accessible \nHousing into two categories, and speci fying applicants to follow the Virginia Universal Design \nStandard. DHCD also received two comments suggesting that the Housing for Older Adults point category not require applying accessibility standards to all housing units in the development.  The 2021 Q AP did award points for projects that included units designed and \nreserved for seniors and\/or people with disabilities, with maximum preference awarded to Projects for seniors (55+) in which all units met either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. The 2023 QAP, however, acknowledges the differentiated needs of seniors and \nother special -needs groups by allocating points to both Housing for Older Adults and \nAcce ssible Housing. Applicants may receive points for the Housing for Older Adults category if \ntheir proposed mix fully complies with the Fair Housing Act and Housing for Older Persons Act \nof 1995 (HOPA) Exemption.  DHCD disagrees with the assertion that requir ing certain  \naccessibility stan dards for housing for older adults  is an unreasonable requirement to obtain \npoints.  DHCD is of the opinion that requiring units for older adults to have a minimal standard \nsuch as ANSI Type A units allows residents to age in p lace and prolong their ability to stay in \ntheir community.  \nOne commenter asked for clarity on the point allocation for age restricted housing for people \n62+ or age restricted housing for people 55+. Points will be awarded to applicants regardless of which of the three HOPA Exemptions they qualify for: (1) developments specifically designed \nand operated to assist elderly persons; (2) developments intended for, and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older; and (3) developments intended and operated  for occupancy \nby persons 55 years of age or older. One additional point is awarded to Projects that target \nthe 62+ age range.  \nAccessible Housing  \nDHCD received a comment recommending against requiring projects to meet ANSI Type A \nstandards for all housing units. The 2023 QAP awards points for Projects where all units meet \nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility standard s. ANSI Type A \nis an adaptable unit, unlike UFAS or ANSI Accessible units, which do not have grab bars and \nother features installed at construction . These standards are  to ensure buildings and facilities \n\nDocument 41:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 42 To qualify for this category, projects must provide a marketing and resident selection plan \nthat addresses leasing to the underserved population(s) and a detailed supportive services \nplan that explains  the programming and how it will be funded long -term .  \n \nHousing for Older Adult s (Up to +5)  \nPoints  will be awarded for Projects that include units designed and reserved for seniors \n(55+ or 62 +), including assisted living  and independent living  units . Maximum  points will be \nawarded  to Projects that provide assisted living units . Points  will be awarded, in \ndescending order, for independent living  age restricted  housing  for people aged 62+, and \nage restricted housing  for people aged 55+ , including grandfamily units.  \n   \nIf the proposed project includes  assisted living, independent living, or age restricted  \nhousing, all units must be accessible utilizing either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. Type A units are adaptable units that can allow seniors and people with mobility \nissues to age in place. Type A units must meet the requirements as defined in Chapter 11 of the 2013 District of Columbia Building Code .  \n Applicants receiving these points must affirmatively demonstrate that their proposed mix is fully compliant with the Fair Housing Act and the Housing for Older Persons Act of 1995 \n(HOPA) Exemption.  \n \nAccessible Housing ( Up to +5)  \nMaximum points will be awarded to Projects that meet The Kelsey design standards\n at \neither the Silver\/Gold\/Platinum level and\/or utilize Universal Design as defined in the \nVirginia Universal Design Standard .

Type A units must meet the requirements as defined in Chapter 11 of the \n2013 Distr ict of Columbia Building Code: https:\/\/codes.iccsafe.org\/content\/chapter\/9182\/ . \n \nHomeownership and Wealth -Building (Up to +8) \nPoints  will be awarded for P rojects emphasizing  wealth -building opportunities for current or future \nresidents, either through homeownership or resident services and programming . \n \nMaximum points will be awarded for Projects that provide  homeownership opport unities to  \nresidents  immediately upon completion of construction or rehabilitation . This includes fee \nsimple ownership, condominiums, Limited Equity Cooperatives, and shared equity models such as community land trust -supported Projects . Points will be awarded for Projects  that are  \nstructured to transfer to tenant ownership after the initial  15-year  compliance period , through \nthe Right of First Refusal provided for in Section 42(i)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code . Partial \npoints will be awarded for Projects that provide wealth -building services that may better \nprepare tenants to be homeowners, including but not limited to positive rent reporting for credit scores, rent payment incentives, connecting unbanked or underbanked residents to financial institutions, or shared appreciation.  \n\nDocument 147:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 56  of 59  are designed and constructed to accommodate individuals with mobility impairments, \nparticularly those who use mobility aids like wheelchairs or scooters. Nonetheless, Projects may also receive points if they provide twice the number of accessible and audio\/visual units as required by Section 504, allowing d evelopers greater flexibility depending on their \ndevelopment model and target populations. These standards are meant to ensure that a percentage of units are accessible, or that all building units are adaptable.  \nPoints for Wealth -Building and Other Program  Suggestions  \nDHCD received comments recommending the following changes to the scoring:  \n\u2022 Additional points in the \nHomeownership and Wealth- Building  category for \nProjects providing homeownership opportunities;  \n\u2022 Elimination of the Maximizing Density  point category; \n\u2022 Additional points for Maximizing Impact of DHCD Resources ;  \n\u2022 A standalone scoring opportunity for victims of domestic violence in the \nPrograms to Address Additional Barriers to Housing  category; and  \n\u2022 Reincorporation of partial points in the Resilient Buildings and Innovative \nDesign  category for preservation projects  \nIn regard to the above suggestions, DHCD will continue to assess the impact of the  current  \nchanges to the Evaluation Criteria in this and future application rounds, but has not made further updates to the Evaluation Criteria at this time.  \nOne commenter suggested adding a new evaluation criteria with a preference for small buildings of 50 units  or less. DHCD does not intend to add a preference for small buildings at this time.  \nNon -Profit Participation and Right of First Refusal  \nSeveral commenters wrote to suggest specific changes to the Right of First Refusal (ROFR) requirements: one suggested that the ROFR be effective after the end of the credit period; \nanother that the purchase price calculated by the project accountants be deemed final other \nthan due to manifest error. The requirements in the QAP related to a ROFR are considered the \nminimum requirements; terms that may be more favorable to the holder of the ROFR are \nsubject to negotiation between the developer and its investor.  \nDHCD will monitor investor exit and Year 15 issues as they arise. Several industry partners are monitoring current litigation and other Year 15 issues across the country, and may be the best \nresource for non- profit organizations in their partnership searches and negotiations.  \nOne commenter suggested that this category be re -named to better reflect the focus on the \nright of first refusal, and that points match the 2021 QAP  (a two -point reduction from the \n2023 QAP) . DHCD will monitor the impact of this change to the scoring criteria, and will make \nany necessary adjustments in future QAPs\/RFPs . \nAffordability  Period Restriction  \nOne commente r suggested  that a perpetual affordability restriction \u2013  defined as a term of 99 \nyears \u2013 be a Threshold requirement for all projects awarded LIHTC, or that the points awarded \nfor projects selecting perpetual affordability be increased .  \n\nDocument 125:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 34  of 59  The scoring  for PSH units  is guided by Chapter  4 of the Interagency Council on \nHomelessness\u2019 (ICH)  2021-2025  strategic  plan, titled Homeward DC 2.0, available at : \nhttps:\/\/ich.dc.gov\/page\/homeward -dc-20-ich-strategic -plan -fy2021 -fy2025  \nFamily -Oriented  Units   \nMaximum points  will be awarded to Projects  in which  at least 30%  of the affordable  units \nhave  three  or more  bedrooms.

In this regard, DHCD is  largely  in line with its peer allocating agencies, many of \nwhom distinguish affordability requirements and priori tization between credit types, and \nwhether or not projects receive  public gap financing in addition to LIHTC allocations.  \nIn this update to the QAP, DHCD will award maximum available points in the Affordability \nPeriod Restriction  sub-category to projects that utilize a  developer -initiated  ground lease  held \nby the District,  emphasizing  another viable tool for ensuring long -term affordability  outside of \na covenant alone.  Effectively converting private land to a public asset, as the commenter \ndescribes, ensur es that policymakers maintain  a decision -making role in the future use of the \nproperty  \u2013 and, further, will provide additional protections tha n standalone covenants, such as \naffordability restrictions  that survive  in the case of a foreclosure.  \nThe threshold affordability requirement and points allocation for long -term affordability \ncommitments ha ve otherwise  not been changed at this time. DHCD will continue to assess \nthese tools and incentives for future QAPs and RFPs .  \nCosts and Expenses  \nDHCD re ceived a comment recommending Design Guideline criteria in lieu of or in conjunction \nwith construction cost guidelines. Construction cost guidelines calculated on a per -square foot \nbasis provide a simple, across -the-board standard which still allows  for va riability based on \nmarket conditions and individual teams\u2019 design preferences. It should also be noted that some \ndesign elements are accounted for in the Enterprise Green Communities standards, DC\u2019s \nBuilding Energy Performance Standards, and other concurrent compliance processes. DHCD will continue exploring the best ways to evaluate construction costs and will further assess whether it may be appropriate to implement additional design standards. No related change to the QAP has been made at this time.  \nDHCD  received a comment recommending a Real Estate tax abatement for for -profit entities. \nThis policy recommendation would require citywide legislation through the DC Council budgeting process. No change has been made to the QAP at this time.  \nDHCD received a c omment requesting that the LIHTC Compliance Monitoring Fee be \nexcluded from operating expenses. As an annual fee, it is eligible as an operating expense. No \nchange has been made to the fee schedule at this time.  \nDHCD received a comment suggesting that not all HPTF projects be required to comply with \nDavis Bacon labor and wage standards. This is a Federal statutory requirement through the Davis -Bacon Act, as Amended, that did not originate with the Qualified Allocation Plan; Title 40, \nSec. 3142 of the law sp ecifically states that either Federal or District of Columbia contracts in \nexcess of $2,000 will utilize the labor and wage standards. The agency is aware of the impact Davis Bacon requirements have on construction costs and accounts for that premium during underwriting review. No change has been made to this requirement at this time.","conversation_history":[],"metadata":{"question_type":"situational","seed_document_id":135,"situational_context":"A project developer diligently compiles compliance documentation to ensure adherence to the intricate regulations and policies governing low-income housing projects, eager to receive necessary tax credits without incurring penalties.","topic":"Affordable Housing Regulations"}}

INTRODUCTION\nIn 2019, in respons e to p opulation growth, an insufficient housing supply, a nd  structural r acial \ndisparities, Mayor Muriel Bowser o utlined bold housin g goals for the Distric t to create 12,000 ne w \naffordable housing units and preserve 6,000 existing affordable h o using units b y 2025. Known \na\ns the H o using Fr amework f o r Equity a n d Growth, a s eries of supporting documents outlined an \nintegrated f ramework f or increasin g housing production a nd pr omotin g equit y for existing and \nf\nuture residents.

Since 2019 , more t han 7,600 n ew affordable \nhousing uni ts have been c reated.1 \nIn 2022, the Bowser A dministration r ecognized tha t bolder h ousing eq uity goals as well a s more \nintentional a c tions were needed t o address the racial d isparities in homeownership and h o u sehold \nweal th in the District. F o r example, the h omeownership r ate for B lack h ouseholds i n the Distric t is \n34% compared to nearly 4 9% for w hite households.2 Additionally, a first -time ho m e buyer with the \naverage i ncome o f a DC Black h o usehold c ould afford just 8 . 4% of homes sold in t he D istrict \nbetween 2016 a nd 2020, c ompared t o a b uyer w ith the average income of a white household, \nwhich could afford 71% of thes e homes.3 Recent trends such a s rising i nterest r ates ha ve likely \nfurther exacerbated dispariti es. To that end, the Black Homeownership Strike Force was convened \nby the Mayor in June 2022 to h elp the District chart a path to not only rectify the harmful \nd\niscriminatory p olicies of the past but also i ncrease and p r eserv e access to homeownership f o r \nlongtim e District r esidents i n an equitable m a nner. The culminatio n of the S t rike Force\u2019s w ork is \nreflected in the Black Homeownership Strike Force Final Report. As further described in the \nreport, the District has a bold new goal --  20,000 new Bl ack homeowners by 2030. In addition, \nt\nhe report discusses the launch of new tools such as the development  of a Public-P rivate \nHomeownership Fund.  \nI\nn 2023, th e District of Columbi a faces evolving c ha llenges to wards t he continued goal of \nsupporting t he preservation and p r oduction of a ffordabl e housing.

Applicants  should refer to and adhere to the guidelines as well \nas any additional parameters included in this RFP.  \n \nSpecial Note for Mixed- Income or Mixed- Use Projects:  \nDHCD sources cannot fund non -eligible uses, such as commercial space . Non-eligible  \nuses  within the same ownership entity as the affordable units  must be displayed  in the \nForm 202 Rental Development Budget Tab and must show the  portion of each \nsource that is allocated to eligible and ineligible uses.  \n \nThe applicant must be able to show that the portion of the building that is ineligible \nfor DHCD funding can be financed without DHCD assistance, regardless of whether \nthe DHCD component is separated for legal and tax purposes . For example, if a \nProject has ground floor retail or market rate units, t he applicant  must demonstrate \nfinancing commitments (or realistic interest) from non- DHCD lenders or investors \nsufficient to cover the costs associated with that portion of the building.  Projects \nshould include all income for the project on the Rental  Income Tab of the Form 202.  \nFor Projects utilizing a condominium or tax lot structure, a separate sources and uses \nbudget should be submitted for the non-DHCD financed portion of the building.  \n \nApplicants cannot d ivert funds from a source that is generated  by income from eligible \nuses or eligible cost basis (such as LIHTC equity or the portion of debt attributable to \naffordable units) to fund ineligible expenses, thereby creating a larger funding gap for DHCD to cover . \n Please note that appraisals, market studies and letters of intent for equity and debt are required to be submitted for both the DHCD and non- DHCD portions of a mixed -\nincome  building, regardless of whether the DHCD component is separated for legal \nand tax p urposes .  \n \nSpecial Note for Homeownership Projects:  \nAdditional worksheets have been incorporated into Form  202 for homeownership \nprojects . Financing applications for homeownership p rojects must use the updated \ntemplate to the greatest extent possible to capture the details of their proposal. \nHowever, to allow DHCD to fully evaluate homeownership proposals, applicants can \nalso submit any other spreadsheets or documents that reflect the nature and  \nfinancing\/construction details of the project, and sale of its units , if not fully captured \nin the Form 202 . \n \n6. Acquisition Cost Reasonableness \nProposed property acquisition costs must be reasonable and may not exceed the \nproperty\u2019s fair market value as evidenced by an appraisal. DHCD will determine reasonableness through an analysis of the appraisal  and the proposed flow of funds . \n\nDocument 115:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 24  of 59  Acquisition Cost Reasonableness \nProposed property acquisition costs must be reasonable and may not exceed the property\u2019s fair \nmarket value as evidenced by an appraisal. DHCD will determine reasonableness through an \nanalysis of the appraisal and the proposed flow of funds. DHCD reserves the right to request a \nsecond appraisal.  \nFor Project s where the property has already been acquired, acquisition cost reasonableness will be \nbased o n the original purchase price plus reasonable carrying and settlement costs. If the property \nwas previously purchased by a party affiliated with the Developer\/Owner\/Sponsor, has increased in \nvalue, and the Project  budget reflects the current appraised value of the property, DHCD expects a \nreasonable proportion of the net proceeds from the increased property value to be offset by a seller\u2019s note or other similar instrument.  \nProjects that received or will receive discounted land or property through a Distric t LDA or PDA \nmust reflect the value of the write -down in their budget. The budgeted acquisition price for \nthese Project s must either be zero, minimal, or if the budget reflects the full appraised value of \nthe property, offset by a seller\u2019s note or other similar instrument.  \nFinancing  Letters  and Terms  \nApplicants must submit letters of interest or letters of commitment from  all participating lenders \nand investors.  Financing terms should be consistent with what is commonly available in the \nmarket for a particular funding source and will be evaluated on a source -by-source  basis. \nApplicants intending to utilize the minimum set -aside for Income Averaging must submit written \nacknowledgment from the LIHTC investor\/ syndicator of this intention.  \nAs part of each LIHTC equity  Letter of Intent , applicants are required to ask  potential  investors  or \nsyndicators  to submit a written acknow ledgement  that they have never sought to achieve early \ntermination of a LIHTC extended use agreement through the qualified contract process , nor have they \nsought to undermine the exercise of a right of first refusal or a non- profit\u2019s option to purchase in prior \ntransactions as described in more detail in the Non -Profit Participation and Right of First Refusal section.  \nFinancial  Information  for Operational  Projects  \nFor existing  and occupied  buildings\/properties  ONLY, additional  information  is required  to \ndescribe the Project \u2019s current  status,  including;  \n\u2022 the current  debt  structure;   \n\u2022 any operating  subsidies  currently  available to the Project ; \n\u2022 any supportive services  currently provided;  \n\u2022 the current  occupancy ; and \n\u2022 Project  financials. \nThe applicant  must  provide  audited  financial  statements  for the prior  three  fiscal  years  of \nProject  operations.  If audited  statements  are not available,  then three fiscal years  of un-audited \nyear -end financial  statements  AND  three corresponding  years  of certified  federal  income  tax \nreturns  of the Project  must  be submitted.  \n\nDocument 26:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 27 DHCD reserves the right to request a second appraisal. An appraisal update will be \nrequired before closing so that a current appraised value is available within 120 days \nof closing. If federal funding is proposed, the acquisition cost (regardless of how it is \nfunded) may not exceed the market value per a new or updated appraisal made within 120 days of closing on DHCD financing.  \n For Projects w here the property has already been acquired, acquisition cost \nreasonableness will be based on the original purchase price plus reasonable carrying \nand settlement costs. Applicants must submit the following for DHCD to determine reasonableness: the deed, the appraisal at the time of acquisition, the HUD -1 \nsettlement sheet at the time of acquisition to demonstrate the purchase price and associated settlement charges, and detailed assumptions behind carrying charges \nincluded in the budget since acquisition.  \n \nIf the property was previously purchased by a n Affiliate of the \nDeveloper\/Owner\/Sponsor, has increased in value, and the project budget reflects the current appraised value of the property, DHCD expects a reasonable proportion \nof the net proceeds from the increased property value to be offset by a seller\u2019s note \nor other similar instrument. DHCD defines a reasonable proportion as the  increase in  \nvalue of the property  since the initial acquisition that exceeds  a maximum rate of \nreturn  of 13% to the owner. The 13% amount is consistent with  twenty -year historic \nreturns for apartment R eal Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) according to data from \nthe National Association of R eal Estate Investment Trusts  \n(https:\/\/www.reit.com\/data -research\/reit -indexes\/annual -index -values -returns\n). If the \nproperty was acquired as a result of tenants exercising their TOPA rights, the final purc hase and sale agreement with the seller must be provided.  \n \nIf the property includes existing improvements that will be demolished as part of the \ndevelopment plan, the appraisal takes the cost of demolition into consideration for an \u201cas vacant\u201d land value.  \n \nProjects that received or will receive discounted land or property through a District \nland or property disposition (LDA or PDA) must reflect the value of the write- down in \ntheir budget. The budgeted acquisition price for these projects must either be zero , \nminimal , or if the budget reflects the full appraised value of the property, offset by a \nseller\u2019s note or other similar instrument.  \n \nIf applicable, LIHTC projects must use their best effort to include the acquisition c osts \nin eligible  basis, consi stent with Section 42 (d)(2 )(B), Section 42 (d)(2)(D), and Section \n42(d)(6)  of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n7. Financing Letters  of Interest, Intent, or Commitment \nApplicants must submit letters of interest or letters of commitment from all other participating financial sources , including permanent, construction, and \npredevelopment financing sources  for all proposed financing  scenarios . Financing \n\nDocument 23:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 24 If at any point during the application review process or underwriting , the Zoning \nCommission disapproves a pending Map Amendment or PUD application that would \nbe required to allow the P roject to proceed as designed, the P roject will be \ndisqualified from fur ther consideration and, if applicable, will be removed from the \nunderwriting pipeline. \n \nFinancial Criteria  \n \n5. Development Budget and Operating Proforma  \nThe financial component of this application is a multi -tab spreadsheet titled \u201c Form \n202 \u2013 Application for Financing \u201d (Form 202) that will be provided by DHCD \n(available within the Online Application System ). The Form 202 has been revised for \nthis RFP and a pplicants must use the most recent version of the form.  \n \nApplicants will use the Fo rm 202  to present the details of their  proposal , such as the \ndevelopment budget; operating pro -forma ; LIHTC and other tax credit calculations (if \napplicable ); homeownership \/sales  assumptions (if applicable ); and unit information, \nincluding an MFI  designation by unit size, which will be recorded in the Land Use \nRestrictive Covenants . The f inancial infor mation  submitted  must make a compelling \nand coherent case f or the funding request, and all data must match the \ncorresponding information provided elsewhere in the Online Application.   \n \n \n \nThe Form 202  should  contain a realistic set of sources and uses, development \nbudget, and pro forma operating budget and be  based on solid assumptions \n(operating expenses, development costs, vacancy rate, debt service coverage ratios, interest rates,  LIHTC raise rates, funding levels for reserves , etc.). The proposed \nbudgets should be  realistic and viable , but demonstrate m aximum leverage of non-\nDHCD funding and minimize the gap funding request. The assumptions and figures should be  consistent throughout the application, consistent with market data and \nsupporting documentation (the appraisal and market study), and follow the instructions and guidance issued by DHCD through this RFP and any subsequent \nQ&As published through the Online Application System.  \n DHCD  is a gap lender and seeks to minimize the amount of District funds \nnecessary to complete a project . Applicants must demonstrate that they \nhave pursued and secured all other feasible funding sources before  applying \nfor DHCD funds.  This includes private debt and equity, as well as other below -\nmarket sources, such as but not limited to green and solar tax credits or rebate \nincentives, private and foundation grants, subordinate seller notes, property \ntax exemptions, and deferred developer fee.

Operating Subsidies  \n \nLocal Rent Supplement Program (LRSP)  \n This District of Columbia LRSP provides operating subsidy to  serve  extremely low income \nfamilies (0 -30% of MFI) and is administered by DCHA . LRSP is administered in accordance \nwith federal and District of Columbia Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) rules and \nregulations (24 CFR Chapters 982 and 983) (14 DCMR Chapters 49, 51,53,54,56,59,61, 93 \nand 95) as administered by DCHA.  Most  of LRSP operating subsidies  available through this \nRFP will be prioritized for PSH units receiving funding from DHCD, DBH, and\/ or DHS, but a \nportion of the operating subsidies will  be available  for non -PSH 30%  units restricted at 30% \nof MFI . The term of  the initial LRSP contract  (the Long Term Subsidy Contract or LTSC)  is 15 \nyears with possible extensions. The LRSP is subject to funding availability.  \n \nOn July 1, 2023 , DCHA modified the process for determining rent reasonableness and utility \nallowances in accordance with HUD guidelines .  Contract rents  are no longer determined by \nestablished submarket  rent limits . Rather, contract  rents will be  based on  individual unit \ncharacteristics \u2013 project location , number of bedrooms , square footage of rooms, type and \nage of the unit,  and the amenities , services, and utilities  provided by the owner . Only \ncomparable units that are unassisted (i.e. those units not benefiting from any rental subsidy) \nwill be used by DCHA to determine rent reasonableness.  \n DCHA is required to obtain the approval of the Council of the District of Columbia (DC Council) before DCHA may enter into an Agreement to Enter Into a Long Term Subsidy \nContract (ALTSC) with the Owner of the Project. Prior to submitting the ALTSC to the D C \nCouncil for approval, DCHA will make a rent reasonableness determination of the proposed \ncontract rent to Owner for each bedroom type for the Project based on the individual unit characteristics described to DCHA in the Owner\u2019s application. In accordance  with program \nrequirements, prior to financial closing and entering into the ALTSC, DCHA shall make an \nadditional rent reasonableness determination and such reasonable rent will be reflected in \nan exhibit attached to the ALTSC. When the units are ready for  occupancy, DCHA will \n\nDocument 59:  \n2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  \n 60 conduct an updated rent reasonableness determination to confirm whether or not the rents \nreflected in the ALTSC need to be increased or decreased to remain reasonable. The results \nof the final DCHA rent reasonableness determination will be incorporated in the contract \nrent exhibit to the LTSC between DCHA and the Owner. For application purposes, applicants should conduct their own market analysis to estimate reasonable rents.  \n Rental units must meet minimum standards of health and saf ety, as determined by HUD\u2019s \nNSPIRE (National Standards for the Physical Inspection of Real Estate) , or applicable HUD \ninspection standard. A housing subsidy is paid to the landlord directly by DCHA  on behalf of \nthe participating household . The household  then pays the difference between the actual rent \ncharged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program.  \n \nDavis Bacon prevailing wage rates apply to any project that uses LRSP.  \n \nD. Tax Exemptions  \n \nNon- Profit Affordable Housing Developer Tax Relief Program  \nNon-profit developers applying for financing through this RFP, both LIHTC and non -LIHTC, \nare eligib le for tax relief under the Non -Profit Affordable Housing Developer Tax Relief \nProgram.  \n Applicants need to submit a tax relief certification application to DHCD\u2019s Office of the General Counsel. DHCD will provide a tax relief certificate to the project prio r to closing \nthat can be presented to the DC Office of Tax and Revenue which grants the applicable tax relief.  \n The required f orms for applying for the tax relief certification are available here\n. \n \nContractor\u2019s Exempt Purchase Certificate (OTR -553)  \nContractors completing wor k for a non -profit entity are eligible for a sales tax exemption \nthrough DC\u2019s Office of Tax and Revenue (OTR). Purchases mad e by the non -profit entity will \nneed to request a separate exemption certificate fro m OTR .  \n \nOTR has provided a guide for requesting the exemption here . \n \nE. Case Management -Supportive Services  \n \nSupportive Services Funds  \n \nDHS will provide funding for the provision of case management  services to  single adults and \nfamilies who reside in PSH units developed through this RFP. DHS prioritizes funding for \nprojects that expand the total pool of available PSH resources. Existing PSH (and other \nforms of existing service enriched housing) and occupied units are not a priority for DHS \n\nDocument 4: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  5 Ther\ne are several other  notable shifts in the affordable housing ecosystem in the District.  \nAdditional resources from the 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 an historic investment \nin clean energy at the federal level, with an estimated $10 billion of loan, grant, and tax \nincentive opportunities for affordable housing projects and low -income communities \u2013 are \nstarting to take shape, and are expected to become available over the next several years. \nMeanwhile, the demand for available Private A ctivity Bond Volume Cap (Bond Cap) issued \nby the District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA) has exceeded supply , making \nthis resource and the associated 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) competitive \nfor the first time. Efficiency requirements  for projects of at least 10,000 square feet of gross \nfloor area where at least 15% of the total cost is financed by the District  are substantially \nincreasing through t he accelerated implementation of the Greener Government Buildings \nAmendment Act (D.C. Law 24 -306), requiring net zero energy compliance  for these projects \nacross the board . Lastly, as of July 1, 2023, operating subsidies through the Local Rent \nSupplement Program (LRSP)  administered by the DC Housing Authority (DCHA)  are no \nlonger  determined by submarket rent limits , but rather by an individual unit\u2019s size, type, age, \nlocation, and the amenities, services, and util ities provided by the owner.  \nIt is in this context that the DC Department of Housing and Community Development  (DHCD) , the \nDC Housing Authority (DCHA), the DC Department of Behav ioral Health (DBH), the DC \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS), the DC Department of Health (DOH) , and the D epartment \nof Energy and Environment (DOEE)  release this Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) , the \nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s primary vehicle for awarding federal and local funds for affordable housing.  \nBecause there is an existing  pipeline of projects that require  tax-exempt  bond cap allocation \nthrough 2025 , this Consolidated RFP will focus on affordable rental projects that do not request \ntax-exempt bonds and 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC ) structures (referred to as \nNon-Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond structures  or scenarios ) as well as  homeownership \nprojects.  \nThe \nrequirements  of this RFP  are specifically guided by the following:  \n\u2022the \nhousing and geographic goals outlined in Mayor\u2019s Order 2019- 036 and the\nHousing Equity Report;\n\u2022the District\u2019s FY24 Fair Shot Budget;\n\u2022the Five Year Consolidated Plan for FY 2022 \u2013 2026;\n\u2022the Housing Production Trust Fu nd (HPTF) statutory requirement that at least 90% of\nproject obligations  go to units for households earning no more than 50 % of Median\nFamily Income ( MFI ), and half for households earning no more than 30% of MFI ;5\n5 D.C.

The tax credits  may not exceed  the applicable  percentage  of the qualified  \nbasis of each  low income  building in  the Project  as defined  in IRC \u00a742(d) : \n\u2022 9% LIHTC:  New construction  and rehabilitation  Project s are eligible for a  \nfixed  tax credit  of not less than  9% if placed  in service after  July 30, \n2008 . \n\u2022 4% LIHTC:  Project s financed  with tax -exempt bonds  under  IRC \u00a7103 or \ninvolving  the acquisition  of existing  buildings  (when  combined  with \nsubstantial  rehabilitation)  are eligible  for a fixed tax credit of not less than \n4% if placed in service after December 31, 20202. \n\u2022 Basis Boost:  Project s located  in a Qualified  Census  Tract (QCT) or a \nDifficult Develop ment  Area  (DDA) , or other  tracts  as defined  in this QAP,  \nare eligible for a boost  to their  eligible basis  of up to  30%  as needed  to \nguarantee  the Project \u2019s financial feasibility. \nA reservation of 9% T ax Credits is made after DHCD does an initial review of the Project budget \nsources -and-uses statement to determine the Project \u2019s feasibility and is conditioned upon the \ndevelopment\u2019 s sponsor meeting certain requirements  as described in this QAP.  Those applicants \nsatisfying the requirements will be given an allocation of tax credits.

Project eligibility  requirements  are defined  in the Threshold  Eligibility  Requirements  \nsection  of the QAP.  \nTypes  of Federal  Low Income  Housing  Tax  Credits  \nThere  are two types  of federal LIHTCs:  9% Tax Credits  from the District \u2019s per-capita State  \nCeiling and  4% Tax Credits  issued  to qualifying  Project s financed  with tax-exempt bonds.  \n\u2022 9% Tax Credit:  The 9% Tax Credit  is competitively  awarded  to eligible  \nProject s based on the  evaluation  criteria  in this QAP,  as may be clarified  by \nthe most  recent  Consolidated Request for Proposals  for Affordable Housing  \nProjects (\u201cConsolidated RFP \u201d). The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%. The \nmaximum LIHTC  amount allocated  to a Project  is determined  by a formula  \nthat considers the amount  of eligible  costs  and the percentage  of qualified  \ntenants.   \n\u2022 4% Tax Credit: Projects financed with certain tax -exempt bonds may be \neligible to receive a 4% Tax Credit without regard to the District\u2019 s per capita \nState Ceiling. The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project . For \nProjects  placed in service after December 31, 2020, the applicable \npercentage must be no less than 4%. T ax-exempt bond financed Project s must \nbe evaluated against the Threshold Eligibility Requirements  in this QAP .  \nBoth types of tax credits  must  comply  with two DHCD  monitoring  procedure guideline \ndocuments :  the \u201cDHCD  Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and HOME Investment Partnerships \nProgram Owner\u2019s  Compliance Manual\u201d  and the most recent \u201cRFP Compliance and Monitoring \nReference Guide, \u201d which  is incorporated  by reference  in this QAP , and available here: \nhttps:\/\/dhcd.dc.gov\/service\/project -monitoring . \nPer IRC \u00a7 42(e)(3), Projects  must  include either  new construction or substantial  rehabilitation  \nexpenditures totaling  the greater  of $7,900 per unit  for calendar year  2023 (subject to annual  \nincrease)  or 20%  of the adjusted basis  of the building(s).   Projects  that meet the substantial  \nrehabilitation requirements  may also be eligible  for a  tax credit  based  on the acquisition  of the \nbuilding.  \n\nDocument 141:    \n \n \nDHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 50 of 59  Tax Credit: The LIHTC issued pursuant to the program, IRC \u00a7 42.
