DHCD strongly supports communities that offer housing for a range of household incomes, and must make resources available to household s with a wide variety of income levels.   \nTwo commenters shared that it is more important to select projects that best respond to critical needs, particularly those that advance the HPTF statutory income targets, instead of focusing on requirements for developer qualifications.

DHCD also received two comments suggesting that the Housing for Older Adults point category not require applying accessibility standards to all housing units in the development.  The 2021 Q AP did award points for projects that included units designed and \nreserved for seniors and\/or people with disabilities, with maximum preference awarded to Projects for seniors (55+) in which all units met either the Uniform Federal Accessibility \nStandards (UFAS) or the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Type A accessibility \nstandards. The 2023 QAP, however, acknowledges the differentiated needs of seniors and \nother special -needs groups by allocating points to both Housing for Older Adults and \nAcce ssible Housing.

DHCD disagrees with the assertion that requir ing certain  \naccessibility stan dards for housing for older adults  is an unreasonable requirement to obtain \npoints.  DHCD is of the opinion that requiring units for older adults to have a minimal standard \nsuch as ANSI Type A units allows residents to age in p lace and prolong their ability to stay in \ntheir community.  \nOne commenter asked for clarity on the point allocation for age restricted housing for people \n62+ or age restricted housing for people 55+.

These structures\/ examples are not an exhaustive list and Applicants can \nsubmit other structures provided they comply with the requirements  in this RFP . \n1.Example Structures\n\u2022Non-Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond (Non -MMRB) with conventional, low -\ncost debt, DHCD gap financing, and other non- DHC D sources \ni.The use of HPTF is subject to the 49% limitation of total project uses .\n\u20229% LIHTC project, with or without local or federal gap financing \/LRSP : Projects\napplying for 9% LIHTC in this RFP will be subject to specific requirements\ndepending on whether they are also applying for LRSP and\/or DHCD gapfinancing.\ni.9% LIHTC projects without DHCD gap financing  or LRSP , for example,\nare not subject to Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) requirementsand are not subject to the Davis -Bacon Act  labor and wage standard s;\nsee the Threshold Eligibility Requirements  section for more detail.\nii.DHCD reserves the right to limit the 9% LIHTC available to eachproject to maximize the LIHTC  resource and to substitute gap\nfinancing. The use of HPTF is subject to the 49% limitation  stated\nabove.\niii.Projects may provide a primary and an alternative  9% LIHTC scenario\nthat include and do not include DHCD gap financing  and\/or LRSP .\n\u2022Affordable Component in Mixed -income and \/or Mixed -use project \u2013 affordable\nunits could be master leased, owned and operated under the same entity as\nthe market rate units, or the building could utilize a condo or tax lot structure.\ni.At l east 30% and no more than 50% of the  total number of  units must\nbe reserved for hous eholds at or below 50% MFI, and must be\ndistributed evenly throughout the p roject .\nii.The proposed p roject must also meet the following parameters:\n\u2022Half of the affordable units must be 30% MFI\n\u2022Only PSH units can receive LRSP  in a mixed -income project\n\u2022If 100% of the affordable units are 30% MFI, LRSP may fund non -\nPSH units. DHCD reserves the right to adjust and size either theLRSP or  HPTF \/gap financing.\niii.For leverage scoring, the permanent mortgage generated by themarket rate rents that would go to subsidize the affordable units may\nbe counted as subsidy.\niv.Projects that have at least 51% ownership by a non- profit  are eligible\n\nDocument 7: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  5 Ther\ne are several other  notable shifts in the affordable housing ecosystem in the District.  \nAdditional resources from the 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 an historic investment \nin clean energy at the federal level, with an estimated $10 billion of loan, grant, and tax \nincentive opportunities for affordable housing projects and low -income communities \u2013 are \nstarting to take shape, and are expected to become available over the next several years. \nMeanwhile, the demand for available Private A ctivity Bond Volume Cap (Bond Cap) issued \nby the District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA) has exceeded supply , making \nthis resource and the associated 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) competitive \nfor the first time. Efficiency requirements  for projects of at least 10,000 square feet of gross \nfloor area where at least 15% of the total cost is financed by the District  are substantially \nincreasing through t he accelerated implementation of the Greener Government Buildings \nAmendment Act (D.C. Law 24 -306), requiring net zero energy compliance  for these projects \nacross the board . Lastly, as of July 1, 2023, operating subsidies through the Local Rent \nSupplement Program (LRSP)  administered by the DC Housing Authority (DCHA)  are no \nlonger  determined by submarket rent limits , but rather by an individual unit\u2019s size, type, age, \nlocation, and the amenities, services, and util ities provided by the owner.  \nIt is in this context that the DC Department of Housing and Community Development  (DHCD) , the \nDC Housing Authority (DCHA), the DC Department of Behav ioral Health (DBH), the DC \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS), the DC Department of Health (DOH) , and the D epartment \nof Energy and Environment (DOEE)  release this Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) , the \nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s primary vehicle for awarding federal and local funds for affordable housing.  \nBecause there is an existing  pipeline of projects that require  tax-exempt  bond cap allocation \nthrough 2025 , this Consolidated RFP will focus on affordable rental projects that do not request \ntax-exempt bonds and 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC ) structures (referred to as \nNon-Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond structures  or scenarios ) as well as  homeownership \nprojects.  \nThe \nrequirements  of this RFP  are specifically guided by the following:  \n\u2022the\n\nDocument 21: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  14 2.Optional Tools\n\u2022District-held ground lease:  Direct District acquisition using a purchase and\nleaseback agreement, subject to the rules of 10 -801(C), with either a capitalized\nup-front payment, a de minimus annual payment, or a cash flow contingent\nannual payment.

The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%. The \nmaximum LIHTC  amount allocated  to a Project  is determined  by a formula  \nthat considers the amount  of eligible  costs  and the percentage  of qualified  \ntenants.   \n\u2022 4% Tax Credit: Projects financed with certain tax -exempt bonds may be \neligible to receive a 4% Tax Credit without regard to the District\u2019 s per capita \nState Ceiling. The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project . For \nProjects  placed in service after December 31, 2020, the applicable \npercentage must be no less than 4%.

Lastly, as of July 1, 2023, operating subsidies through the Local Rent \nSupplement Program (LRSP)  administered by the DC Housing Authority (DCHA)  are no \nlonger  determined by submarket rent limits , but rather by an individual unit\u2019s size, type, age, \nlocation, and the amenities, services, and util ities provided by the owner.  \nIt is in this context that the DC Department of Housing and Community Development  (DHCD) , the \nDC Housing Authority (DCHA), the DC Department of Behav ioral Health (DBH), the DC \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS), the DC Department of Health (DOH) , and the D epartment \nof Energy and Environment (DOEE)  release this Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) , the \nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s primary vehicle for awarding federal and local funds for affordable housing.  \nBecause there is an existing  pipeline of projects that require  tax-exempt  bond cap allocation \nthrough 2025 , this Consolidated RFP will focus on affordable rental projects that do not request \ntax-exempt bonds and 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC ) structures (referred to as \nNon-Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond structures  or scenarios ) as well as  homeownership \nprojects.  \nThe \nrequirements  of this RFP  are specifically guided by the following:  \n\u2022the\n\nDocument 21: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  14 2.Optional Tools\n\u2022District-held ground lease:  Direct District acquisition using a purchase and\nleaseback agreement, subject to the rules of 10 -801(C), with either a capitalized\nup-front payment, a de minimus annual payment, or a cash flow contingent\nannual payment.

DHCD  will determine  if the benefits  to the \nDistrict  are sufficient to warrant  the issuance  of a Forward  Reservation.  In \nmost  cases this determination  will rely primarily on the following  factors:  \n \n1. whether  the Sponsor \u2019s\/Developer \u2019s LIHTC  request is large  enough  to \nrequire being split because an award in a single year would eliminate the \navailability  of LIHTC to other  competitive  applicants; and \n2. if the scope of the rehabilitation or construction is such that it is unlikely that the entire Project  can be \u201cplaced in se rvice\u201d within the time frame required \nby the IRC.  \nProjects  Unable  to Meet  Deadlines  \nSome  Project (s) that have  received  Reservations are not  able  to meet  the schedule outlined in  \nthe Reservation  for reasons beyond  the control of the Developer but  are Project s the DHCD  \nDirector may deem  to be essential  to DHCD \u2019s strategic  plan  or mission.

Upon this request, DHCD \nwill review  the development budget for continued feasibility to reflect any changes in the \ndevel opment\u2019 s cost and\/or financial structure before granting a C arryover Allocation.  \nAfter a building has been placed in service ( i.e., the building construction or rehabilitation is \nsubstantially complete and\/or a  Certificate( s) of Occupancy is  received), the Sponsor\/Developer \nwill request IRS Form(s) 8609 to begin claiming the Tax Credit on its federal tax return. A final analysis by DHCD  will be performed at the time of placement in service to determine the final \nTax Credit Allocation Amount, which is the lesser of: (1) the tax credits necessary to make the development feasible; or (2) the amount of the earlier C arryover Allocation.  \nProje cts that apply for tax -exempt bonds are eligible to request 4% Tax Credits.  Consistent \nwith an inter -agency  agreement  between  DHCD  and the District of Columbia Housing Finance \nAgency (DCHFA) , before the Project  closes  on the tax-exempt bonds,  DCHFA submit s the \napplication  to DHCD  for the allocation  of tax credits.    \nTax  Credits  Available  \nThe amount  of 9% Tax Credits  available  for the District  to allocate  in each  calendar year  \nreflects  the sum of the amounts  allowed  as the per-capita  State Ceiling  under  IRC \u00a742(h)(3)(C).  \nThis amount may be  increased  by: (1) returned  tax credits  from  prior  years; (2) tax credits  \nallocated  to the District from the  national  tax credit  pool;  or (3) new legislation  increasing the \namount of  tax credits  distributed  to each  state.  \nAny unallocated  or recovered  9% T ax Credits  or a combination  of both may be: (1) awarded  as \npart  of the current  year cycle(s)  of awards  for tax credits;  or (2) carried  over  to the next year \u2019s \ncycle(s) of awards  at DHCD \u2019s discretion.  \nThe amount of available 4% Tax Credits  is not subject to a ceiling and  corresponds with the \nannual amount of qualified Private Activity Bond Volume Cap (Bond Cap) allocated to a \nProject . As of 2023, the demand for available Bond Cap exceeds sup ply, such that tax -exempt \nbonds and associated 4% LIHTCs are now a llocated  competitively.\n\nDocument 153: DHCD 2023  Qualified Allocation Plan, Page 6  of 59 DHC D Program Overview   \nEligibility  \nExperienced  for-profit  and non-profit  Sponsor\/Developers  that are in good  standing  with the \nDistrict  (as defined  in the Development Team Thresholds  section  of the Threshold  Eligibility  \nRequirements  Section of th e QAP ) are eligible  to apply  for a  reservation of LIHTC to fund  \nresidential  rental  property  developments  located  in the District  that are affordable  to \nhouseholds  earning  60%  of the Area  Median  Gross  Income  (AMGI  or AMI ) or less , or 80% \nAMGI or less if the Average Income  minimum set -aside election is used as described further on \npage 1 7.

The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%. The \nmaximum LIHTC  amount allocated  to a Project  is determined  by a formula  \nthat considers the amount  of eligible  costs  and the percentage  of qualified  \ntenants.   \n\u2022 4% Tax Credit: Projects financed with certain tax -exempt bonds may be \neligible to receive a 4% Tax Credit without regard to the District\u2019 s per capita \nState Ceiling. The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project .
