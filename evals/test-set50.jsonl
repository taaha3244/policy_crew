Operating Subsidies  \n \nLocal Rent Supplement Program (LRSP)  \n This District of Columbia LRSP provides operating subsidy to  serve  extremely low income \nfamilies (0 -30% of MFI) and is administered by DCHA . LRSP is administered in accordance \nwith federal and District of Columbia Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCVP) rules and \nregulations (24 CFR Chapters 982 and 983) (14 DCMR Chapters 49, 51,53,54,56,59,61, 93 \nand 95) as administered by DCHA.  Most  of LRSP operating subsidies  available through this \nRFP will be prioritized for PSH units receiving funding from DHCD, DBH, and\/ or DHS, but a \nportion of the operating subsidies will  be available  for non -PSH 30%  units restricted at 30% \nof MFI . The term of  the initial LRSP contract  (the Long Term Subsidy Contract or LTSC)  is 15 \nyears with possible extensions. The LRSP is subject to funding availability.  \n \nOn July 1, 2023 , DCHA modified the process for determining rent reasonableness and utility \nallowances in accordance with HUD guidelines .  Contract rents  are no longer determined by \nestablished submarket  rent limits . Rather, contract  rents will be  based on  individual unit \ncharacteristics \u2013 project location , number of bedrooms , square footage of rooms, type and \nage of the unit,  and the amenities , services, and utilities  provided by the owner . Only \ncomparable units that are unassisted (i.e. those units not benefiting from any rental subsidy) \nwill be used by DCHA to determine rent reasonableness.  \n DCHA is required to obtain the approval of the Council of the District of Columbia (DC Council) before DCHA may enter into an Agreement to Enter Into a Long Term Subsidy \nContract (ALTSC) with the Owner of the Project. Prior to submitting the ALTSC to the D C \nCouncil for approval, DCHA will make a rent reasonableness determination of the proposed\n\nDocument 7: 2023 DHCD Consolidated Request for Proposals  5 Ther\ne are several other  notable shifts in the affordable housing ecosystem in the District.  \nAdditional resources from the 2022 federal Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 an historic investment \nin clean energy at the federal level, with an estimated $10 billion of loan, grant, and tax \nincentive opportunities for affordable housing projects and low -income communities \u2013 are \nstarting to take shape, and are expected to become available over the next several years. \nMeanwhile, the demand for available Private A ctivity Bond Volume Cap (Bond Cap) issued \nby the District of Columbia Housing Finance Agency (DCHFA) has exceeded supply , making \nthis resource and the associated 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) competitive \nfor the first time. Efficiency requirements  for projects of at least 10,000 square feet of gross \nfloor area where at least 15% of the total cost is financed by the District  are substantially \nincreasing through t he accelerated implementation of the Greener Government Buildings \nAmendment Act (D.C. Law 24 -306), requiring net zero energy compliance  for these projects \nacross the board . Lastly, as of July 1, 2023, operating subsidies through the Local Rent \nSupplement Program (LRSP)  administered by the DC Housing Authority (DCHA)  are no \nlonger  determined by submarket rent limits , but rather by an individual unit\u2019s size, type, age, \nlocation, and the amenities, services, and util ities provided by the owner.  \nIt is in this context that the DC Department of Housing and Community Development  (DHCD) , the \nDC Housing Authority (DCHA), the DC Department of Behav ioral Health (DBH), the DC \nDepartment of Human Services (DHS), the DC Department of Health (DOH) , and the D epartment \nof Energy and Environment (DOEE)  release this Consolidated Request for Proposals (RFP) , the \nDistrict of Columbia\u2019s primary vehicle for awarding federal and local funds for affordable housing.  \nBecause there is an existing  pipeline of projects that require  tax-exempt  bond cap allocation \nthrough 2025 , this Consolidated RFP will focus on affordable rental projects that do not request \ntax-exempt bonds and 4% Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC ) structures (referred to as \nNon-Multifamily Mortgage Revenue Bond structures  or scenarios ) as well as  homeownership \nprojects.  \nThe \nrequirements  of this RFP  are specifically guided by the following:  \n\u2022the\n\nDocument 99: Contract (ALTSC) with the Owner of the Project.

DHCD  will determine  if the benefits  to the \nDistrict  are sufficient to warrant  the issuance  of a Forward  Reservation.  In \nmost  cases this determination  will rely primarily on the following  factors:  \n \n1. whether  the Sponsor \u2019s\/Developer \u2019s LIHTC  request is large  enough  to \nrequire being split because an award in a single year would eliminate the \navailability  of LIHTC to other  competitive  applicants; and \n2. if the scope of the rehabilitation or construction is such that it is unlikely that the entire Project  can be \u201cplaced in se rvice\u201d within the time frame required \nby the IRC.  \nProjects  Unable  to Meet  Deadlines  \nSome  Project (s) that have  received  Reservations are not  able  to meet  the schedule outlined in  \nthe Reservation  for reasons beyond  the control of the Developer but  are Project s the DHCD  \nDirector may deem  to be essential  to DHCD \u2019s strategic  plan  or mission.

Upon this request, DHCD \nwill review  the development budget for continued feasibility to reflect any changes in the \ndevel opment\u2019 s cost and\/or financial structure before granting a C arryover Allocation.  \nAfter a building has been placed in service ( i.e., the building construction or rehabilitation is \nsubstantially complete and\/or a  Certificate( s) of Occupancy is  received), the Sponsor\/Developer \nwill request IRS Form(s) 8609 to begin claiming the Tax Credit on its federal tax return. A final analysis by DHCD  will be performed at the time of placement in service to determine the final \nTax Credit Allocation Amount, which is the lesser of: (1) the tax credits necessary to make the development feasible; or (2) the amount of the earlier C arryover Allocation.  \nProje cts that apply for tax -exempt bonds are eligible to request 4% Tax Credits.

For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%.

Project eligibility  requirements  are defined  in the Threshold  Eligibility  Requirements  \nsection  of the QAP.  \nTypes  of Federal  Low Income  Housing  Tax  Credits  \nThere  are two types  of federal LIHTCs:  9% Tax Credits  from the District \u2019s per-capita State  \nCeiling and  4% Tax Credits  issued  to qualifying  Project s financed  with tax-exempt bonds.  \n\u2022 9% Tax Credit:  The 9% Tax Credit  is competitively  awarded  to eligible  \nProject s based on the  evaluation  criteria  in this QAP,  as may be clarified  by \nthe most  recent  Consolidated Request for Proposals  for Affordable Housing  \nProjects (\u201cConsolidated RFP \u201d). The 9% Tax Credit  is based  on a 10-year \npresent  value calculation  of 70%  of the qualified  basis of  each  building  in the \nProject . For those non -federally  subsidized  new buildings placed  in service  \nafter  July 30, 2008,  the applicable  percentage must  be no less than 9%. The \nmaximum LIHTC  amount allocated  to a Project  is determined  by a formula  \nthat considers the amount  of eligible  costs  and the percentage  of qualified  \ntenants.   \n\u2022 4% Tax Credit: Projects financed with certain tax -exempt bonds may be \neligible to receive a 4% Tax Credit without regard to the District\u2019 s per capita \nState Ceiling. The 4% Tax Credit is based on a 10 -year present value \ncalculation of 30% of the qualified basis of each building in the Project . For \nProjects  placed in service after December 31, 2020, the applicable \npercentage must be no less than 4%.
