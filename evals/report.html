The RFP specifies that at least 90% of project obligations must go to units for households earning no more than 50% of the MFI, and half of those must be for households earning no more than 30% of the MFI. This ensures that the funding prioritizes affordable housing for low-income families, aligning with the goals of the Housing Production Trust Fund (HPTF) and the broader housing equity objectives outlined in various district plans and reports.\\n\\nThe relevance of MFI in this context is significant as it directly influences the funding allocation and the types of projects that can be considered for support.

These procedures include several key components:\\n\\n1. **Physical Inspections**: DHCD conducts regular physical inspections of low-income housing projects to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\\n\\n2. **Review of Certifications**: The agency reviews low-income certifications submitted by project owners, along with the documentation that supports these certifications. This ensures that the income levels of tenants meet the required thresholds.\\n\\n3. **Rent Records Examination**: DHCD examines rent records for tenants occupying low-income housing units to verify compliance with rent restrictions.\\n\\n4. **Recordkeeping and Retention**: Project owners are required to maintain detailed records for each year of the compliance period. This includes documentation that supports the low-income certifications and other compliance-related records. Failure to maintain these records can lead to penalties, including the recapture of tax credits.\\n\\n5. **Notification of Noncompliance**: If DHCD identifies any noncompliance during its monitoring activities, it promptly notifies project owners in writing. The notice includes a cure period of up to 90 days for the owner to rectify the noncompliance issues. If the issues are not resolved, DHCD may report the noncompliance to the IRS, which could result in further penalties.\\n\\n6. **Compliance Period**: The compliance period for low-income housing projects is set for 15 years, beginning with the first taxable year of the building\\u2019s credit period.

This adjustment helps in maximizing the financial resources available for property improvements.\\n\\n2. **Modification of Affordability Covenants**: If a property is subject to an existing affordability covenant, applicants can request modifications to the MFI (Median Family Income) mix of the covenant.

These sources can provide necessary funds that complement the primary financing for the recapitalization.\\n\\n4. **Interim Income Contribution**: Property owners are encouraged to contribute interim income or a reasonable percentage of accrued replacement reserves to the rehabilitation efforts.
